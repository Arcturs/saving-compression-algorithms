Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn'splitSize hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations."
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A3UH4UZ4RSVO82,John Granger,10/11,5.0,1078790400,Essential for every personal and Public Library,"If people become the books they read and if ""the child is father to the man,"" then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, ""the other sides of Dr. Seuss"" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a ""must buy"" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon."

Perry ""amateur philosopher""",7/7,4.0,1090713600,Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment,"Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house."
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A22X4XUPKF66MR,"D. H. Richards ""ninthwavestore""",3/3,4.0,1107993600,Good academic overview,"Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to ""cash in"" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man."
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A2F6NONFUDB6UK,Malvin,2/2,4.0,1127174400,One of America's greatest creative talents,"""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the ""Disneyification"" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes ""threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism"". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents."

Giesel created not only his famous imaginative picturebooks, but a unique art and poetry, and even a place for himself in politics. Philip Nel argues that these added activities make Dr. Seuss one of the most influential people in America - certainly the most influential poet - and Dr. Seuss: American Icon provides the reader an memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss' many achievements."

Squire,0/0,5.0,1231200000,Academia At It's Best,"When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: ""Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don'splitSize want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won'splitSize be an enjoyable read.""Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. ""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more.

0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A3VA4XFS5WNJO3,Donald Burnside,3/5,4.0,1076371200,Fascinating account of a genius at work,"As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don'splitSize believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose."

As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can'splitSize help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use.

This is the book on worship,"I hadn'splitSize been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!"

I then like the last review noticed that the ""Traveling librarian"" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game.

On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!"

""The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him."" Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction.

I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn'splitSize have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the ""wicked saints"" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on ""other reviews"" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!"

The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of ""nations"" across the waters."
0802841899,The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today,25.97,ARI272XF8TOL4,Christopher J. Bray,74/81,5.0,955411200,Ecclesiological Milestone,"With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder."

Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!

Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values.

Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"

All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn'splitSize even speak English good, end of quote.

But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices.

Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for ""Dramatica For Screenwriters"", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in ""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place.

However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn'splitSize care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don'splitSize know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn'splitSize have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide."

She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media."

At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book ""Aerobics"" (a term he coined), then to ""Aerobics Program for total Well Being..."", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book ""Start Strong, Finish Strong"" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading."

What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own."

The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled ""sour cream sour"" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn'splitSize want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven'splitSize had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, ""It is a slice of Heaven!"". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can'splitSize wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up."

But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don'splitSize expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast?

Briggs ""Tessa B""",8/14,3.0,1241827200,Not your quick refrence cookbook,"After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The ""sourdough lore"" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more ""authentically old"" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don'splitSize know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can'splitSize cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don'splitSize have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS. Cover waffles with ice cream, meringue, pancakes, ham, make them a sandwich, cook them with curry and dip them in fish paste. YUCKO!"

Don'splitSize get me wrong, ""Alaska Sourdough"" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from ""on the trail"" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers.""Alaska Sourdough"" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of ""Alaska Sourdough"" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation."

Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book."

Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended."

Erickson,18/19,5.0,1105315200,Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument,"I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P.

0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,,A3CP1WGNTOSKDA,"Tim Naff ""Tim""",1/1,5.0,1278115200,A Superlative Planning Aide and Top-level Guide,"This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for ""getting our heads in the game"" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn'splitSize get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven'splitSize decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn'splitSize buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don'splitSize see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can'splitSize fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn'splitSize cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven'splitSize started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!"

Derecola ""wasadz""",1/1,5.0,1172448000,Good Overall Idea,"I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including ""Europe"". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more ""popular"" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each."

Hadley,72/72,4.0,1090540800,Colourful Digest Of Places To See In Europe,"I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the ""tiny"" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn'splitSize teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn'splitSize judge how ""good"" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you."

Get this book!,"If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides."

It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won'splitSize soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review"

ZAIDI ""Ali Zaidi""",11/13,4.0,1033689600,Helpful guide on tours through Europe,"I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the ""Museum of Arsenal"" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well."

He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars. But in general, &quot;The History of Magic and Occult&quot; is a &quot;compact encyclopedia&quot;, you'd like to own."

These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study."

First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation."

(From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn'splitSize given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book!

It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives.

The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the ""mission creep"" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world."

0887402216,The Battleship Bismarck,34.95,A30IUAABSEHEPI,Lawrence Duckles,9/9,3.0,1055980800,The Battleship Bismarck reviewed,"This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's ""Pursuit,"" published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, ""Seekriegsleitung"" gets translated as ""sea-war-leadership,"" which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term ""naval operations,"" which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research."

The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living.

Some of his statements: There are unfortunately a great many people with attractive surface attitudes but with the same old rubbish underneath (9), If you fail to direct your subconscious mind, it produces under a law of averages, and you are a nice, ineffective sweet person (84), I call treatment mind surgery.

Treat Yourself to Life is a manual for productive living -- a self-help book you might say -- and Barker provides a straight-forward approach for getting what you want in terms of love, wealth, health and self-expression.Skeptics may cringe at the author's faith in the individual to create his own destiny through the book's teaching, but Barker responds by urging the reader to assess the merits of the teaching based on real results for the individual.The books divides into chapters on Happiness, Wealth, Love, This Day, Success, Freedom and Life, and offers a method to improve one's experience with regard to each. Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view. Yet the teaching seems more positive and offers a greater faith in human nature. Surely, the reader will have to decide for himself."

Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won'splitSize welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn'splitSize expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won'splitSize be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas.

Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting.

She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago. Will she be able to have peace, and be with Colin, the person she has grown to love? Read this very interesting novel to find out. I really enjoyed reading this.

It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute.

The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book.

0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,A1E8JE7ZU91ZS5,John Bolender,20/20,4.0,935971200,Much more sensible than most books critical of the field.,"This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don'splitSize realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover."
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,,,12/13,4.0,893203200,Fascinating and Terrifying,"Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can'splitSize figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don'splitSize agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care."
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,,,9/11,4.0,983059200,"Informative, but left me wanting more","I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn'splitSize say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did'splitSize give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don'splitSize suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine."
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,A18TBJTWXAFKBN,Mira de Vries,1/1,3.0,1310256000,Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?,"Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn'splitSize mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn'splitSize said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf"

In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, ""I don'splitSize want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was."" Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though ""there wasn'splitSize much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better."" Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly."

He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said ""Let me sign the kids first"". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish. LeaBron is a great role model to young kids because he never gave up and told himself that he could do it. LeBron now is in the NBA and won the Rookie of the Year award.Written by Gerald P.

B0006DWYDW,Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft,,A2ROJNY48QN55E,Reviewer,4/4,5.0,1230422400,Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever,"This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was ""green"" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term ""stick built"" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. ""Wood never lies to you."" ""You don'splitSize just hack away obliviously."" As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:""To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries.""Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a ""passivhaus"" or ""passive house"", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a ""green"" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8"" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes."

B0007DQIIS,"The ancient constitution and the feudal law,: A study of English historical thought in the seventeenth century",,A2UIXU97JYCPZG,R. Albin,6/6,4.0,1259193600,Interesting,"An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing."

Thanks to my grandparents, I didn'splitSize become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn'splitSize disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, ""The Seance"" and ""The Letter Writer"" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form."

Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions.

Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of ""Yanda"" is a provincial prostitute, while ""Zeitl and Rickel"" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a ""take a book, leave a book"" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable."

Not just for open marriage.,I feel that this book can apply to every romantic pairing. This is not just a book for those contemplating an open marriage. This is a book that can give you great ideas regarding space in a relationship. It expands on the idea that just because you are part of a couple does not mean you have to give up yourself. It promotes the idea of still mainting and developing new ideas and hobbies about yourself. It really has so very little to do with sex and more to do with keeping your own life exciting and not expecting the marriage to solve all your fulfilment needs.
B0006D6DRK,"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples,",,A1TPG8HAHKTM8I,"""mcorraink""",20/21,5.0,1083888000,An Excellent Book about Open Marriage - NOT Swinging!,"The title of this book has become misleading only because the meaning of the words ""Open Marriage"" has changed over the decades.This book is an excellent guide for people interested in all the aspects of attaining and living in an open marriage, which is an overall way of life, not just sexual freedom. Everything from sex to doing the dishes is covered in this book. Some of the language may sound dated since it's original printing, but then again, so does Shakespeare.This the best book I have ever found to learn about ALL aspects of your marital relationships (not just the sexual ones) and discover the ways in which people try to control and eventually destroy each other as individuals within a marriage.If you want a book on ""swinging"" (a/k/a recreational, non-monogomous sex) then this is NOT the book you are looking for. But then again, Open Marriage is leaps and bounds beyond just swinging. This book guides you through making this a way of life in a wonderful way, changing the traditional marriage views in ALL aspects, including non-monogomous sex, but not JUST sex.How do I know this? I've been living this way for 15 years and still going happy and strong. My first ""traditional"" marriage lasted 3 years."
B0006D6DRK,"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples,",,A1IMB8FTTTJN12,parnassus2,16/18,5.0,1162425600,"title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging","Please don'splitSize be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn'splitSize worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an ""open"" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum ""An unexamined life is not worth living"" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:""The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride.""One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in ""bitter disappointment"" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn'splitSize going well, and someone angrily threatened that ""we all had better start having fun right now!"" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental ""maps"" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine."

By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is ""together until death"" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, ""open marriage"" back then didn'splitSize mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don'splitSize have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don'splitSize have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn'splitSize share. You don'splitSize have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don'splitSize make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about ""the grass is always greener"", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the ""love and sex without jealousy"" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren'splitSize very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a ""one and only way"" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the ""emotional infidelity"" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn'splitSize."

It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree. If you dare to read this book, be prepared to be radically changed forever!"

Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel. HIs stories read at supersonic speed and purposefully divert the reader from thinking about the plot, characters, conflict,etc. Recommended solely for no-depth crowd of mystery readers (90% of readers are in this category; hence, the popularity ofjames patterson, Sue Grafton, Kellerman's,and many more; can anyone actually read Elizabeth George's prose and not become constipated and nauseous). Also, irrelevant romance between Mary's defense atty and female prosecutor. Added nothing to story, except perhaps to be a lame red herring that the femme fatale might have something to do with the murders."

That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in ""Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective"". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:""I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won'splitSize be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn'splitSize have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: ""Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette.""Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: ""Can'splitSize you say anything but hello?""Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don'splitSize call them that) and their description of the universal life force as ""The Prime Cause,"" are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can'splitSize get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson"

Jones ""kjay12""",6/6,5.0,1041120000,Open your mind and your heart!,"This book is one of the most profound and wonderful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading! It's a beautiful true story that tells of two animal communicators, Mary and her good friend Raphaela, and their conversations with Granny. Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all. Granny's words certainly opened my eyes and made me see things in a different light. Open your mind and your heart. Read this book!"

After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing"

Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don'splitSize get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don'splitSize think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can'splitSize. She didn'splitSize give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in ""Freeing Keiko"" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn'splitSize too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn'splitSize. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies.

By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that ""pro-Israel lobbying groups"" and others are ""policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."" Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers ""effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."" That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards."

However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn'splitSize pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]"

Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."

Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic ""anatomy"", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can'splitSize think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

B000H45MXO,THE SECULAR CITY -SECULARIZATION AND URBANIZATION IN THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,,AHD101501WCN1,"Shalom Freedman ""Shalom Freedman""",2/2,5.0,1156809600,A profound if somewhat exaggerated analysis of 'global secularization',"How the world has changed since Harvey Cox argued that there is an inevitable and inexorable process of global secularization which is leading to a total separation of the political and religious. Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past."

Davis ""The Rose Bride""",0/2,1.0,1177718400,Disappointing to say the least,"This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don'splitSize know. To me, she didn'splitSize come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn'splitSize much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn'splitSize so sharp tongued, if there weren'splitSize so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn'splitSize so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda."

Ms. Smith developed the characters very well. The only improvement for this book should be the style and wording of the text. Even though L.J.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,884476800,The Best of the Night World,"Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can'splitSize compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn'splitSize go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period."

Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J.

Then you'll know what I'm talking about!! OK!!???"
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/1,5.0,874368000,My favorite of all her books!!!!!!!,"This is the best book L.J. has written, and I've read all seven (they're all good). I'm still waiting for Black Dawn to come out. Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,3/4,5.0,1047600000,Second Book in the Night World Series,"Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, ""Daughters of Darkness"" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven'splitSize read any of the other books in this series and can'splitSize compare this one to the others, I really liked ""Daughters of Darkness."" It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances."
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,7/10,5.0,943401600,This book had me giggling,"I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don'splitSize know, maybe the way I said it isn'splitSize that funny, but I thought it was hillarious.

She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn'splitSize want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won'splitSize want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven'splitSize read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!"
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,2/3,5.0,905644800,THIS IS MY FAV BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!,"This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven'splitSize read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well. I hope you bring in Mary-Lynette and Ash again, I would really like to know the outcome."

Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A3CLKX8W3F1L1D,Werther Bentine Torres,0/0,3.0,1276560000,Quick and Fun,"As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions."
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A2KBHSK5BS35BH,Leeanna Chetsko,0/0,1.0,1260662400,Night World 2: Daughters of Darkness,"Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, ""Daughters of Darkness"" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, ""Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh.""Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from ""Night World #1: Secret Vampire,"" where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can'splitSize stand each other.But something about this book just didn'splitSize do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn'splitSize fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5."

There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings.

The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored.

Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn'splitSize just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn'splitSize really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette."
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,2/2,5.0,870134400,"Daughters of Darkness, a love story in a supernatural series","Personally, I feel this book is the best in the Night World series, because I love the character Ash. He is such a hottie, though he has many personality flaws and actions to be ashamed of. That just makes him a more realistic character. Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J. Smith's, because in incorporates all creatures of the night. I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can'splitSize I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere? That series must be out of print, though it isn'splitSize old"

Fisher ""Raye""",4/5,3.0,1019001600,"Murder, mystery, werewolves, vampire and soulmates","Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn'splitSize a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn)."
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,AB5E23ZV79CVZ,"VampireNovelFan ""VampireNovelFan""",1/1,4.0,1322524800,Worth a read,"Book 2 of the Night World series, Daughters of Darkness, shifts focus to a new set of characters of the secret society. Relatives of James from the first book, we meet Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade. They are three vampire sisters who snuck away from home. Tired of the secret society, they want to try to live as humans out in Oregon. They move into a dilapidated old home, next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter. As Jade and Mark get closer, their brother Ash comes to town to bring his sisters back. Of course, he meets Mary-Lynette and things get interesting...Ash, the handsome blondie who we remember from the first book as being a conniving, selfish, and manipulative, experiences a bit of growth in this book. In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see."
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A2Z72G2EJZFGC9,Deidre Huesmann,1/1,4.0,1200096000,Vampires And Mystery? You'd Be Surprised,"Mary-Lynnette's wants seem simple enough. She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn'splitSize want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren'splitSize even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can'splitSize see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn'splitSize enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future. Publishers, don'splitSize keep faithful fans in suspense!"

I can only find one flaw. No-one, and i mean no-one would just let a hunky guy like Ash just walk away? I mean Come On! As if. OK so what he's done some bad things but hey, you'll get over it. What if something happens to him while he's away and the last thing you said was ""nice line"". But okay that's fine, you wanna let him go? OK. But when do we get to find out if and when he and Mary Lynette get back together? That's just mean not telling us that. But besides that downfall the book was excellent and I love the way L.J.Smith described how they all turned really beautiful after they had fed.

I've read it about a million times, and it never gets tired. I love the romance between Mary Lynette and Ash. The idea of soulmates is very exciting, and the scenes between the two of them are perfect. My favorite part is when Mary Lynette quotes Pride and Prejudice and Ash responds the same way, shocking her. Sigh.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A380A20KGBHX8H,"""wujasmine""",1/1,5.0,1010016000,One of my favourites,"In Daughters of Darkness, LJ Smith outdoes herself. Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie. This was one of my favourites in the series and I am still waiting anxiously for Strange Fate, which is the 10th."

The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn'splitSize appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires.

The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn'splitSize get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other.

The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn'splitSize really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate.

Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire.

The paper is poor quality; it won'splitSize hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out.

All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper."

1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,,,,31/32,5.0,900288000,A superb snapshot of Colonial America up to 1750.,"The brilliant historian Richard Hofstadter was working on this book when he died in 1970. In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter."

Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can'splitSize help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing)."

Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader.

Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was ""God,"" now it is sometimes ""God"" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self."

Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: ""Anti-intellectualism in American Life"": ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays""; ""Social Darwinism in American Thought""; ""The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States.""When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as ""America at 1750"" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in ""The Middle Class World.""One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren'splitSize even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start."

This book really does pack a lot of information into it for you, and it breaks up the monotony of facts and locations by throwing in little stories, examples, and quotes, which give history a little more ""personal"" feeling. The first chapter is a real snoozer, dealing mostly in population figures and growth, but it picks up from there. I also found the last few chapters on religion and the Great Awakening a little redundant, but still interesting."

I'm new to Chicago, and I want to find the places to go off the beaten path.I wish I had skimmed the book before I bought it. In this book, the author reviews places he feels one needs to see. Review after review of restaurants and clubs and stores, the author used descriptions like, ""decent"" and ""nondescript."" In one review, he claims he is ""a tad ambivalent"" about that specific restaurant, and in another, he reviews a bar as being the sort that ""you never want to go to but find yourself in anyway."" Even the places he talked about positively, he never got excited about them. The most you'll get is a restaurant that serves food that is ""quite good."" He spends a good chunk of the book talking about how he is an ""old man"" now, and talks about things he did when he was young and what the neighborhoods of Chicago were like years ago, and in many of his reviews he admits that he hasn'splitSize been to that place in some time. This is fine if that's what you are looking for, but I would recommend a book on Chicago history if that's the case. The last straw was a review of a resale shop that ACTUALLY starts out with, ""Nothing special."" Why include this in your book of places ""you want to know about"" if it is nothing special? I stopped reading the book after that listing, and it went straight in the trash. Worthless."

The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them. Such as the imagery of soldier and violent, and especially the general's black leather glove (maybe symbolic to the idea of totalism?).What interest me the most is the climax of the story; when the boy and his family falls into sleep, and they wake up when peace finally arrives to the country. I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do."

Pullen, in his seminal work ""The Twentieth Maine"" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to ""take the convervative view of men and events."" Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel ""Killer Angels"" and in the movie ""Gettysburg."" Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts.""Recollections"" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times."

The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader.

I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn'splitSize see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses.

Tommaso is a handsome, very Italian looking young man who attracts girls like flies to honey, but who especially appreciates the charms of blonde, non-Italian females. He works as a waiter at one of Rome's most up market restuarants and shares an apartment with his old friend, Bruno, a rather plain looking man who happens to be a brilliant and inspired chef. Laura is an American art history student, in Rome on a scholarship, determined to follow the advice of her Italian girlfriend to find herself a boyfriend who is a chef, as they're supposed to be ""good with their hands"". When Laura and Tommaso meet, he introduces himself as a chef and a Cyrano de Bergerac situation occurs with Bruno cooking incredibly wonderful, sensual meals for Laura, for Tommaso to pass off as his own work. It's an engagingly light read, full of descriptions of mouth watering Italian dishes, overlaid with love and laughter, perhaps not for those readers who aren'splitSize at all interested in enjoying good food...and there are such people...but for those who enjoy the use of all of their senses, a sheer delight!"

I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the clich&eacute; for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away.

Put them all into the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant, throw in a few comic extras (the college teacher with neuroses about food, the barrista determined to brew the best cup of coffee in the universe, ""quaint"" Mafioso, etc), add in a diversion in the rural depths of Le Marche and you have a very jolly read.If you like food, then you can smell the cooking and taste the flavours as they can only be experienced in Italy. You can walk the back streets, visit the markets and learn about the great Roman love of traditional food.My only criticism is that Laura is perhaps a bit over-drawn: she is too obviously a character created by a man rather than a woman and reminded me a little too much of the much admired Nigella Lawson.I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the little asides of very rude Italian slang - a guide on what not to say when in Rome!I will most certainly be looking for other books by this most welcome new author."
0688071643,Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders,,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,Acute Observer,3/3,4.0,1104451200,The Case of the Double Murder,"In Chapter 1 Gil Adrian walks into the Oaks Restaurant. Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn'splitSize know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn'splitSize a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn'splitSize wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series."

Therefore, any fan of Perry Mason will have to accept the disappointment of reading this Mason book by another author of another time. Gardner's style and tone very much that of the thirties and forties, with different terminology and a different level of acceptance regarding how men looked at women.If you are capable of accepting the significant difference in style, then this book can be enjoyed. Some of the characters are changed, for example it is now Paul Drake Jr. doing the investigations and Ray Dallas has replaced Lieutenant Tragg. The hostility between Mason and the police has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect, within the bounds of their professional rivalry; Ray Dallas and Mason are friends.The story is formulaic of the Mason stories, a man is murdered and his estranged wife is falsely accused of the murder. Mason must piece together a series of sometimes-contradictory clues in order to unmask the guilty and free his client. In true Mason fashion, his questioning of a witness leads to a dramatic courtroom event where the murderer is revealed.Although Gardner wrote many Perry Mason stories and they follow a pattern, there are reasons to always want additional stories. Chastain's effort is a worthy addition to this set, while naturally different, it is still within the bounds of what a Perry Mason story should be."

I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again.

B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,A1SG05N5ZLSYAD,Laura L. Wines,42/42,5.0,961113600,&quot;Dinner at Antoine's: An Intriguing Mystery Set in New Orlea,"&quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; written by Frances Parkinson Keyes is set in New Orleans during Carnival Season in January 1948. It is a mystery that endures the generations. I first read &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; ten years ago in 1990. I enjoyed the book so much that it inspired me to make a trip to the Crescent City. My love for the book has not died since that first reading.The mystery is terrific. When I began my second read of the book in May 2000, I was quickly swept into the plot. I didn'splitSize want to stop reading. The book is so well written that the characters, plot and setting come to life before the reader. As Ruth Avery, the main character, sees New Orleans for the first time, I too saw the city for the first time through her eyes. The author gives a complete picture of New Orleans society in 1948 through the many characters that she develops. Joe Racina and his wife Judith are middle class residents. Joe works as a reporter and Judith maintains their home. Judith has chosen not to hire help as she grew up in Connecticut on a farm. To the opposite extreme you have the Lanlande family at the top of society. Other characters include Russell Aldridge, architect; Vance Perrault, doctor; and Tossie Pride, personal maid. &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is an old fashion murder mystery that in the style of Agatha Christie is full of suspects. Once again I was intrigued until the end as I remained unsure of the murderer's identity until it was revealed. This book is by far the author's best and it makes you beg for a sequel.The added bonus to &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; are the physical descriptions of landmarks in New Orleans. The descriptions are so great that this book could almost be categorized as a travel essay. When I traveled to New Orleans, I used &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; as my guide. I quickly found Antoine's Restaurant and in the restaurant I found the Rex Room, 1840 Room, and Mystery Room just as the restaurant had been described by the author. The French bread, tomato aspic, oysters Foch, flaming pressed duck with cream and brandy, cherries Jubilee, and caf&eacute; brulot all enticingly described by the author can still be found on the menu. I quickly moved on throughout New Orleans finding the Court of the Two Sisters, Caf&eacute; Du Monde, the French Market, Jackson Square, the cathedral, St. Charles Avenue, the Garden District, Audubon Park, and the Metaire Cemetery. My most recent reading of the book has me wanting to return to discover the River Road and to find out if the Bar None Restaurant exists with its barbecued chicken, onion rings and corn fritters. Even if I find that the River Road and Bar None only exist in the author's imagination, she has so aptly described them that I will always feel as if I have actually visited.Reading &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is the perfect way to spend a weekend when you want to take a luxurious vacation in the comfort of your home."
B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",36/40,4.0,994464000,Entertaining tale of old New Orleans,"Half soap, half Agatha Christie mystery, this story of New Orleans in the late 1940s is a charming and compelling story of love, deception, and murder. Populated by a complex and endearing (or repelling) cast of characters, this is an excellent story. (And why isn'splitSize it in print?!)Starting off at the restaurant Antoine's, it follows extremely rich playboy Orson Foxworth (yes, that is his real name) introducing his lovely niece Ruth Avery to the rich'n'famous of New Orleans. Among them are the beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed but very lovely widow that Foxworth wants as a lover but is willing to marry; Odile St. Amand, Amelie's daughter, who is suffering from a disease she tries to hide; Leonce St. Amand, Odile's philandering husband; Caresse Lalande, Odile's little sister who is on the brink of a full-fledged affair with Leonce; Vance Perrault, a doctor who cares deeply for Odile; Odile's ex-lover, Sabin Duplessis; Joe Racina, a brilliant journalist, and many many others...After a fateful night where Odile's shaking hands cause her to spill wine on herself (similar to a bloodstain), Amelie refuses Foxworth's proposal as she doesn'splitSize want to leave her poor invalid daughter alone, and Leonce attempts a seduction. Motives are abundant when Odile is found dead in her bedroom - shot through the heart with a gift from her ex-lover. Many lives and destinies will change (some for the better, some for worse) before Odile's killer finds justice of a sort...The pace is pleasant and gradual, allowing us excellent insight into the characters. The descriptions of luxurious houses, restaurants and clothing (especially clothing!) are evocative and entertaining. No threads are left untangled, and the question of motive and reason is, frankly, as excellent as that of the Grand Mistress of Mystery, Agatha Christie.There is only one thing that kept this from being a five-star book: As it was written in 1948, this book has a rather stereotyped portrayal of African Americans, especially Odile's loving nurse Tossie. Despite the stereotype, I was pleased that Tossie was not played for laughs and was one of the more insightful characters in the story. The reader automatically connects with her (especially regarding her low, low, LOW opinion of Leonce) and is warmed by the last chapter regarding her.Though Ruth Avery is sort of the heroine, she is nevertheless not the central character. She is strong and independent, with little thought of social position; and, after Odile's murder, so is Caresse (whom I expected to hate but ended up liking). I hated Leonce, was charmed by Orson Foxworth and Joe Racina. I found the character of Amelie Lalande to be highly annoying, with her self-centered artificiality.Though there are a few pitfalls in this book, it is nevertheless an entertaining (and pretty clean as well) story about mystery and passion in New Orleans, a beautiful city. Well worth the read."

B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,A229U5V2OK7B4D,strickn,1/4,3.0,1186185600,Decoy Mystery,"Picked this recently from Grandmother's shelf; she'd never read it, but her few months living in New Orleans were right around the time of the book. It will be hard for enlightened readers to believe that upper /lower classes would behave and communicate in stereotyped ways; umbrage is mis-taken. Not only can you trust an observant outsider resident of New Orleans writing in 1948 to have a perspective on 1948 New Orleans superior in details to that of postmodern criticism, but it's also easily forgotten by outsiders, even after this hurricane, that, in this city more than any other, people lived their lives in one or two neighborhoods. In other words, life itself was, from an educational standpoint, simplistic and regressive. Craving high-mindedness, a fatalistic New Orleanian you never will be. It's faintly surprising that people want it dressed up. This work sure doesn'splitSize oblige (attention to fashion and finery notwithstanding). Most of its characters do suit a place so set'n its ways that, even as the book was being written, leadership was passing to the smaller (later giant), more creative city that would eventually come to N.O.'s aid from a few hundred miles to the west.It would be standard (and a bit inaccurate) to say the setting is a character here. However, I will say something you rarely hear: stories exist so that the author has something on which to put the real communication. Forget the mystery. I'm nogood at figuring them out, yet I did. That's not what to read for. I read to soak in the place, the author's devotion to it, and then it just fits that the most humbly local person, the part of the tapestry the astute reader kept expecting to find dirt on, is revealed to have been good all along."

I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund."
B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,,ABSEN74HZBNBK,Martha E. Hopkins,3/9,3.0,1153785600,Very dated and predictable mystery,"I decided to read this book after a visit to New Orleans when I toured the home of the author. The book was mentioned during the tour as one of her most famous books.I can see why it is out of print. I almost quit reading it after 50 pages. To become classics, books need to have universal qualities that transcend time and place. Dinner at Antoines is filled with stereotypes.As another reviewer pointed out, the depiction of blacks in the novel is condescending and dated. They all talk like characters in ""Uncle Remus.""The blacks are not the only ones who talk like caricatures. The policeman Murphy talks like an Irish cop from the movies.Other characters also are stereotypes. They are the ruthless businessman (Foxworth), the shallow woman out for his money (Amelie), the noble statesman (Huntington), the philandering husband (Leonce), the flirt (Caresse), Latin beauty (Clarinda), caring old doctor the tough-talking policeman, the rugged archeologist, etc. None of them seemed real to me.The main women characters are interested only in clothes and men. Ruth is a rich 20-something clothes horse with a silver mink coat. Clarinda is considered an old maid at 27. Caresse goes to New York to become a model for a staid department store. None of them seems to have a brain.The plot also seemed a little creaky to me. I figured out ""who done it"" about half way through the book, even though many characters had a motive and there were clues pointing at several. I also easily figured out who would marry whom at the end.Another plot flaw is tha author does a lot of telling readers about characters and what is going on rather than demonstrating it by action.Most of the plot takes place over a week, yet a murder is comitted and solved, an engagement takes place and is broken and replaced by another, and Ruth agrees to fly to Hondourus marry a man she has known a week.As an example of 1950s race, class, and gender stereotypes taken to an extreme, the book is interesting. It was somewhat entertaining, but totally unbelievable. I did not believe in the world portrayed.That is the main difference between a classic like Agatha Christie's novels and this book. I believe in the worlds Christie creates, though they are set in past times and distant places. However, I feel that Parkinson's New Orleans is an unbelievable place with unbelievable people."
0473056070,The Faces of Homoeopathy,,A3FTFSK7XIJZBH,Tal Davidson,2/2,5.0,985046400,The Truth About Homeopathy,"Julian Winston's novel is the most in-depth and informative discussion on homeopathy that I have come across. The book makes good on its claim to insightfully delve into the fundamental philosophy of homeopathy. Also, Winston tackles the important and controversial question of scientific rigor that plagues this medical breakthrough. He makes it systematically clear how the medical philosophy of homeopathy is scientifically rigorous. Also mentioned are the innovative medical thinkers known as the original homoeopaths, the decline of homeopathy at the beginning of the 20th century, and the resurgence of this medical philosophy towards the end of this same century. It is ideal for those readers attempting to gain greater medical recognition of homeopathy or for those just interested in the history of this innovative healthcare technique. If one is looking for in-depth inforamtion on homeopathy that is historical, academic, and interesting, then The Faces of Homeopathy is in my opinion the best book to buy."
0473056070,The Faces of Homoeopathy,,A3S0XF73D7SEN5,TCM,1/1,5.0,1251158400,Not a novel,"This is to correct the previous review: Faces of Homeopathy is not fiction (not a ""novel"") it's the true story of the history of homeopathy focused particularly on the history of homeopathy in the USA. And it's brilliant! Should be on every homeopath's bookshelf; should be on the bookshelf of anyone interested in homeopathy, 17th through 21st century medicine or even just general history."

They're supposedly all in the 250-page Appendix A, but to find one you have to go to the Appendix A section in the table of contents at the beginning of this bulky 1100-page tome, look up the page # listed there, then go to that page. The obvious alternative would be phonebook-style page headers showing the first tag name on each page so readers could locate a tag of interest directly. Why wouldn'splitSize a tech book publisher have this figured out?The cover says &quot;up-to-date for latest versions&quot; of Netscape and IE without specifying dates or version #'s. The printing date is hidden in the ISBN code. I find this practice questionable.Although pages 7 and 682 say all documents should begin with &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, this tag does not seem to be fully described anywhere. The syntax suggested on p. 682 (with a single pair of quotes) conflicts with the HTML 4 examples on p. 60.The book cover trumpets &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage of HTML 4 as well as: &quot;extensive details on Cascading Style Sheets 1 &amp; 2.&quot; One could be forgiven for figuring this means fairly full coverage of CSS. However, the preface draws a distinction between HTML and CSS, speaking of &quot;HTML 4 ... _along with_ new technologies that affect HTML, such as CSS ...&quot; and announces an intention &quot;to do one thing the best I can: cover HTML.&quot; The implicit disclaimer is not idle.

I would suggest this book to anyone who is interested in Site design....I think the name is wrong when it says html complete reference, it does have an excellent reference section but the material in it is invaluable to any type of site your making and with any type of language/script you are using."

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,,,,0/1,5.0,1035763200,The only HTML book you really need,"If you can only have one book on HTML, this is the book to have. No other book I've seen covers HTML and related subjects as well as this one. In addition to HTML, the author covers XHTML, briefly discusses XML, covers basic JavaScript and both CSS (style sheet) specifications as well, in addition to DHTML, which has permeated the Internet.Despite its size and the magnitude of the material presented, the book is logically organized and well thought out, starting from basic and easy material and progressing in difficulty. There are several ways the material could have been organized, and as an experienced HTML writer I would have organized it differently, but I believe the author's organization makes the material more accessible for new and less experienced developers.Any criticisms I may have of this book are very minor compared to the excellent job the author has done with this book, and I would recommend it for anyone who has to write HTML, with or without the aid of an HTML editor."
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,,A29LM35VY9OP1A,Jim Moran,28/29,5.0,949276800,Add Improved Functionality to any Website!,"There are still some folks around like myself who prefer to design Websites and pages using raw HTML &quot;coding.&quot; Windows Notepad is still my top HTML editor of choice. However, whether folks prefer to &quot;code their own&quot; or use standard HTML editing programs, there are clear advantages of becoming familiar with the basics of HTML programming that will pay dividends in the long run. Not all HTML editors are created equal and sometimes inside knowledge is helpful in the Web development process.HTML: The Complete Reference is a huge 2 1/4 - inch book packed with helpful and important HTML Web design information. Here readers will take in a broad scope of Website programming features that will improve, freshen up, and add functionality to any Website. Learn how to use fonts, colors, backgrounds, frames, tables, layers, style sheets, client-side programming, plug-ins, audio and video clips, and more. Plenty of scripting examples are provided to permit immediate results in the Website design process.This reference book includes all the latest tags, Web browser and programming compatibility considerations, and background information needed to produce outstanding Websites. The book reads better as a reference guide than a novel. However, one can learn quite a bit by simply thumbing through it on a casual basis. A particular Web design feature could leap out from a page and arouse interest that could lead to a great design idea!This book recommended for experienced programmers only, who are well acquainted with the in's and out's of Web design concepts. It's a great reference book to have on hand when a programming matter arises or when some changes must take place to liven things up!"

I never buy the first thing I see and I spent many hours researching for the best I could find. My search narrowed down to just a few and this book won the toss. I am truly impressed at what I found here. I purchased several books on related topics (javascript and such) and after reading all of them, this book was, by far, the easiest to use. Mr. Powell's writing style allowed me to retain more than I expected I would. I immediately put into use many of these tags to take my website from average to very efficient (and cool if I do say so myself). The reference section allows me to quickly find more about the tag I am trying to use. Don'splitSize let the enormous size of this book intimidate you. It reads easy and a great deal of the book is reference relating back to what you learned earlier.If you are using a WYSISYG editor to make your website and want to get past those limitations. This IS the book you want. If you don'splitSize buy this book RIGHT NOW, you will someday wish you had. Do it while it's fresh in your head."

The next 475 pages provide a well-organized presentation of HTML mechanics including presentation, layout, cascading style sheets, client/server side programming, DHTML, XML, and web hosting. Throughout this material, sample code is presented and explained to illustrate the concepts presented. Finally, 430 pages of appendices provide reference level detail that will remain valuable indefinitely.The later chapters (programming, DHTML, XML) are overview in nature. (ASP is discussed in five pages.) This is appropriate, for each of these subjects requires a text of their own. The overviews are valuable as they present these subjects in the context of HTML and how they can work together. They also give the reader a basic platform from which to study in greater detail.Certainly worth mentioning also are the numerous tips and valuable remarks sprinkled throughout the book. In my case there were several one-line statements worth the purchase price.This book is a well-written and thorough text that a beginner can use to learn HTML and an advanced web developer can use as a reference or to polish up. I can'splitSize compare this with others books on the subject. It hasn'splitSize been necessary to read any."

A smaller book that puts more emphasis on &quot;teaching&quot; the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both."

PowellOur NST/Engineers company reviewers found this over 1000 page compendium to be an ideal training text and desktop reference for a wide spectrum of web page designers. Individuals working to improve company intranet and extranet communications will be well-served by the examples given of code and scripting followed by what you can expect to see. Professionals seeking guidance in advanced HTML, DHTML, XML, and related internet savvy can expect to increase their understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.We found excellent coverage of the pitfalls of page preparation without knowledge of the differences between popular browser capabilities. The browser versions expected to be in common use for the next few years of Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, WebTV, and a few others, and how to allow for their different interpreting capabilities , is covered throughout the book.Hundreds of pages of appendixes explain what you can and can'splitSize do with HTML elements and style sheets. The function, power, and use of Java Script in its several variations are explained with examples. Author Thomas A. Powell, an expert Web consultant and Internet applications teacher at University of California at San Diego, explains the centrality of HTML while predicting changes that XML and other methods may bring in the future. He cites lots of free online Web sites, at all levels, to augment material in the book.We found the writing style, loaded with useful examples and stabs of humor, to be an easy read. This is a body of knowledge that must be understood at higher than an entry level by industrial, academic, and small business practitioners alike who see the need for an effective Web presence."
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,,,,7/7,3.0,966124800,Not Good Enough,"I bought this book based on the Amazon Reviews and after using it I must disagree with the weight of on-line opinion. Not that it is a bad book. It just isn'splitSize what the reviews led me to expect. My main disappointment is the poor structure and organization. It has a thrown-together feel, more like a collection of separate and poorly integrated sections than a single well-organized book.Some examples: Even after marking the page edges it is still difficult to find what I want quickly. The text sections are only average and not at all comprehensive. To learn HTML or CSS, you'd be better off getting a book (or books) that is not trying to be everything at once. And the reference sections are also a disappointment. The main headers do not stand out from the repeated subheadings so one becomes lost easily. There is not enough detail on differences between the major browsers. The CSS &quot;reference&quot; is a mess. It is broken into subsections which disrupt the alphabetical order and is sorely lacking in the kind of detail that is critical to successful style-sheet implementation.As I said, it's not a bad book. It's just not good enough. For total newbies, Castro's QuickStart Guide is far superior. On CSS, try O'Reilly's &quot;definitive&quot; guide. Not sure what to recommend as an HTML reference. I'm going to try Goodman's &quot;Dynamic HTML.&quot;"

If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away."

I checked the errata section of the website but not a single error in the book was listed there (at the time of writing this). I can'splitSize believe they are unaware of them, especially as this book has been out for several months now.Secondly the author keeps plugging his other book, so much so that he includes an entire chapter from that book here. Although it may of had some relevance I don'splitSize think it should of been added, as in my opinion it was clearly intended as a promotion of his other publication. I certainly don'splitSize object to being made aware of an authors publications, for instance in a list at the end of the book, but not like this.On the plus side this book does cover HTML exceptionally well, all the expected stuff like frames, tables, layers, forms, links, media types etc are explored. XHTML is also covered but don'splitSize expect much, the differences are only in the rules of writing the language, which are explained. Note that there isn'splitSize a chapter dedicated to XHTML but you are made aware of the differences between HTML mark-up and XHTML mark-up when necessary.Like previous editions this book does cover a lot of theory, e.g. logical versus physical mark-up, protocols, mime types, parsed html etc.There is also a chapter dedicated to CSS1 and CSS2 which is pretty complete. The CSS2 section includes coverage on the various new pseudo elements and selectors introduced in CSS2. There is also a reference section covering CSS1 and CSS2 at the back of the book, and it includes proprietary properties for Internet Explorer.SSI is also covered in this book. There are also very basic introductions to XML, JavaScript, server side technologies and DHTML. These are more about what they can do as opposed to teaching you them.The reference section has been organised alphabetically this time, so it is much easier to use than previous editions. They include coverage of XHTML, additions to WebTV, JavaScript event handlers and the usual HTML stuff. There are also reference sections for colour codes and character entities.Finally this is the first Complete Reference book I have purchased that didn'splitSize fall apart, so there is no need to buy a binder this time around."

For example, the structure of an Internet Protocol address is covered twice in two separate sections, for a total of 10+ pages. I find that addressing has been adequately covered in other HTML books in 2-3 pages. As another example, the author mentions a trick of prefetching an image by rendering it with a height of 1 and width of 1. This trick is mentioned in full detail (paragraphs) twice in two seperate sections.The author seems to feel that every chapter should be complete in that it covers all tricks. For a reader who reads several chapters at a time, sections become redundant.

The coverage of the language is excellent, and the section on Style Sheets is very in-depth. Also, the appendicies at the end of the book contain complete information on every HTML tag and their associated attributes for quick look-up.Although this book can be a little difficult to get started, once you get past the introductory chapters and into the section on actual HTML code it is very straighforward.

The biggest flaw in this book, however, is the lack of emphasis on XHTML. The cover boasts that it includes full XHTML within it; however, it is really only one chapter out of the whole book. As someone who likes to keep up with the W3C standards and current technology on web pages, I have found that out of this entire book, I really only use chapter 13 which is on style sheets. I read the book and got to this chapter only to realize that everything I had just read wasn'splitSize information I could use.This book also includes an introduction to other aspects of HTML such as JavaScript and Server Side Programming, as well as, web maintenance. However, it only serves as an introduction and points the reader to other books. This book is great as an overview, but it does a poor job at helping you move from reading about HTML to actually doing the current HTML you would see on your favorite website.I would recommend finding a book on CSS and XHTML that gives a short introduction to the basics of HTML and then gives more emphasis on the current technology being used."

But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won'splitSize need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too."

However only the first few hundred pages cover HTML, and it's covered extremely well to. If you have read any other book on HTML then you won'splitSize believe just how much has been missed out until you read this book. HTML is much bigger than you would have ever thought.The book teaches you a lot of theory, areas such as logical and physical structure, doctype definitions, media types, encoding types (to name but a few) are explored, and the usual tutorials on tables, frames, linking, image maps, graphics, meta tags etc are all there, but more information is provided.There is also a chapter dedicated to style sheets which covers both CSS1 and CSS2. As HTML 4.0 encourages you to use style sheets instead of standard HTML, it was good to see this chapter. This was my first exposure to CSS and I'm very confident using it now. I don'splitSize believe you will have to buy an additional book on CSS.Other chapters include introductions to other technologies like JavaScript, server side programming, XML and DHTML, but these are only basic introductions, do not expect to learn these technologies from those chapters, they just give you a taste.The remainder of the book consists of the reference sections. These throughly cover (among other things) HTML and CSS. The HTML section includes additional tags and attributes specific to each browser, including those for webTv. Character encoding is also covered.I have only two criticisms of this book. Firstly it falls apart in your hands, so if you buy it expect to buy a binder as well. Secondly although the reference section is full and complete it isn'splitSize laid out very well.To sum up this book is both a tutorial and a reference and is always on my desk.I also own the third edition of this book but I don'splitSize think it is as good as this edition."

This band deals with the first true encounter between the fledgling fleet of Terra and the might of the galactic empire.In ""The Cosmic Decoy"" we are reunited with Cadet Julian Tifflor, whom we met in the Mutant Master trilogy of stories. Cadet Tifflor is chosen by Perry Rhodan to become a Cosmic Decoy. At least four of the ships of the Terranian fleet have disappeared, and Rhodan wants to know where they went.In just the first book, we discover that the four missing ships were stolen by the Springers, a race of space-faring traders with no morals other than their own. Julian is prepared for this mission with a ""secret"" message - and a hidden special transmitter that is only capable of being received by people with telepathic powers, such as several members of Rhodan's Mutant Corps. Even Tifflor is unaware that he is a living psychic transmitter. According to plan, Tifflor is kidnapped by the Springers, but he is whisked away to a secret base before Rhodan and his men can catch up. We meet a few of the Springers and begin the process via which Rhodan plans to make the universe believe that the Earth has been destroyed.Next episode - Number 23 - ""Fleet of the Springers"".I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhanger serials like ""Buck Rodgers"" or ""Flash Gordon"" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 2,000 stories. It's too bad American publishers stopped after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another letters column. There are also extra stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and some ""Shock Shorts"" - continuing a series of SF short stories at the end of each book. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at.It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series."

He pays equal attention to the &quot;high art&quot; films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s, like &quot;Volga-Volga.&quot;) He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism, World War II, and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end, the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However, one should be thankful for what one has, and in this volume, one has a truly indispensible book."

This trio consists of ""multicultural rejects""; Justin ""Jay"" is the gay child of Chinese immigrants; Tien Ho, conceived out-of-wedlock during the Vietnamese War by a Vietnamese mother and African-American GI father; and Gibbo, a chubby, white, socially inept Australian who yearns to be Asain. Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:""It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?""The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes. There were other passages and messages in this book that were thought provoking and had me reflecting on my life.As good of a book as this was, I still have to give it an overall rating of a 4-stars because of the ending. It was a little too....... happily ever after, for my taste."

It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic ""No Exit"" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, ""Looking for love in all the wrong places."" Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!"

B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",30/32,5.0,1054771200,Climbing the rungs,"The title of this book, `God was in the Place, & I, i Did not Know', may seem a bit cumbersome (and even, to some, looks like it has a typographical error. However, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner draws this title from the Torah, the book of Genesis to be precise. It is the exclamation of Jacob who, upon waking from his dream about the ladder connecting heaven and earth, makes a startling realisation about the reality of the seemingly mundane and ordinary place where he had stopped for the night.In the prologue, Kushner develops an exegesis and hermeneutic of Genesis 28:16 more fully, and in so doing, illustrates many of the problems we regularly encounter, both in reading scripture as well as in interpreting daily life experience. He places this story in strong connection with the ordinary, even relating the angels on the ladder to common humanity:`There is another, even more obvious interpretation. The angels did not reside in heaven at all. They lived on earth. They were ordinary human beings. And, like ordinary human beings, they shuttled back and forth between heaven and earth. The trick is to remember, after you descend, what you understood when you were high on the ladder.'Kushner examines the way in which sages have interpreted this passage, and provides insights into history, psychology, philosophy, and scriptural study in the process. Each interpretation has had what one might call a personal conversation and experience with Jacob. In fact, each of these interpreters is portrayed as being on the ladder, rising and descending. The text is structured in this way. The interpreters are:+RashiSchelomo ben Yitzhaki, RashiThe key word for this interpretation is awareness. This is very important for making the kind of realisation that Jacob made. It is very important for us as we perceive the presence of God in our own lives.If I had known God was here, I wouldn'splitSize have gone to sleep.+KotzkMenachem Mendl of KotzkThe key concept here is egotism. Only by stripping away the ego can one begin to understand the presence and the personality of God.God was here because I was able to subdue my ego.+LudomirHannah Rachel Werbermacher, the Maid of LudomirA remarkable woman, a teacher of the Hasidim (who listened to her teaching through a half-open door, so as to preserve distance, and perhaps preserve a fiction that they were not in fact being taught by a woman), whose insight gave her access to the other side, or the many other sides, of stories being considered.God is present, even in the midst of evil.+MezritchDov Baer, the Maggid of MezritchThe word Maggid means 'storyteller'. Through the stories, here the key is self-reflection, to find meaning in the innermost being, to find that still, small voice that can only speak in silence and the absence of our own activity.God was here because I stopped being aware of myself.+NachmaniShmuel bar MachmaniWho was Jacob, and why should he know this? Who is God, and why should God do this? These are questions that are historical as much as theological or psychological, and it is in our history and God's history that we find meaning and identity.I could have climbed this ladder of history.+De LeonMoses ben Shem Tov de LeonA remarkable book, lost for a time, whose existence was denied even by Moses de Leon's widow, the Zohar, gives astonishing insight into the interior of God, reality, and our selves, and how to find a deep connection that is always present and never finished. Attributed to another author, Shimon bar Yohai, Kushner speculates that perhaps they shared the same soul. The completeness of the self of the universe connects through Jacob's story here.I is the Lord your God+OstropolShimshon ben Pesach OstropolerBeyond the question and awareness of the self of God and the self of the universe is the self, basic and simple, complex and intricate. Rabbi Shimshon put names to the kelipot, the broken shards of creation. We are all a part of a whole, a broken piece in and of ourselves. Our awareness of this helps begin the process of reunion.I didn'splitSize know that my name was part of God's nameEach interpreter's chapter stands on its own merits, but each is connected to the other, and to a wider body of interpretation and scholarship, by the use of side notes and references done in (what I would describe as being) a proto-talmudic structure. The Talmud has been described by some as one of the world's first hypertexts, with cross-links and chains that lead through the text -- this book does similar linking.Rabbi Kushner concludes by linking all the stories to the reader:`Each person has a Torah, unique to that person, his or her innermost teaching. Some seem to know their Torahs very early in life and speak and sing them in a myriad of ways. Others spend their whole lives stammering, shaping and rehearsing them. Some are long, some are short. Some are intricate and poetic, others are only a few words, and still others can only be spoken through gesture and example. But every soul has a Torah.'The relative place of self (both as an I and as an i) in God's life and universe becomes more apparent through these stories. Human beings are important, yet who can be important in relation to God? Yet, who is not important in relation to God? May this work help you discern where God is in your life, and what you are called to be."
B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A3PJFOIP93JGPE,"Steven Marks ""Prog Harpo""",17/18,5.0,995155200,The hand of God,"As you have gathered from the main review, this book focuses on the meaning of just one verse in Genesis, when Jacob awoke from the ladder dream. Usually Rabbis pick up on a verse just a couple verses back where &quot;the Angels of God were going up and down the ladder&quot;. The focus is that they start on Earth and go to Heaven - not the other way around.This book is great because it is like there is a dialog accross the space-time continuumn with 7 Rabbis in different locations and centuries arguing about their 7 different interpretations.One interpretation based on the fact that there are two &quot;I's&quot; in the verse spelled differently in Hebrew. It is that my Godlike &quot;I&quot; did not know God was present because my ego &quot;i&quot; was in the way. Jacob's chance to experience God was diminished because the ego &quot;i&quot; was ragiling off its commentary. This concept is similar to Buddism.Kushner adds an 8th interpretaion in his prolouge - which I won'splitSize spoil by going into detail. I heard Kushner talk at a Synagouge in Austin, Texas and he summarized his interpretation by finishing, &quot;Hold up your hands before your eyes. You are looking at the hands of God.&quot;A great book on modern Jewish mystism."
B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A2MHUSO8C0XO23,J. Miller,13/13,5.0,1144368000,Poetic and Intelligent,"Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, ""You are all liars!""3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. ""Too much concentration can be worse than none at all"" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The ""I did not know"" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the ""I.""5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, ""Frees slaves,"" and then ""Call anytime"" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the ""I,"" the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, ""God was in this place and I did not know it was i."" We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent."

And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."

B0008852GG,The soul of man under socialism,,A1AWIMIVWGIER,Dana Garrett,2/4,3.0,1338249600,Oscar Wilde: Theory on a Holiday,"Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man under Socialism depicts the tangential and unintended callousness of socialistic thinking when it is merely theoretical and future-based and is not also activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde understands perfectly well that one of the principal goals of socialism is the elimination of poverty: ""The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible."" That might be the aim, but what should be done in the meantime to alleviate the suffering of the poor? In a word, the answer for Wilde is ""nothing."" He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also ""prolong"" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: ""It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair."" While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of ""voluntary association"" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: ""If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.""Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: ""These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation."" Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as ""real"" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled ""The Soul of Man under Socialism.""My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable."

Although, I don'splitSize believe Oscar Wilde's interests included the common Socialist schools. Yet, socialism was the fad of the day. Many intellectuals were interested in the theories, but Oscar was in his eyes an artist and an Individualist. Capital ""I"" on individualist.I couldn'splitSize find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules. Poetry was not controlled because nobody read poetry.I find Oscar Wild a very human elitist and although I thought it sad, I enjoyed his work immensely and this work was no different.(PS: I really appreciate Kindle books. This book was free and I received it immediately. I own at least 100 kindle books.)"

For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile."

It doesn'splitSize have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn'splitSize diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done.

Anderson ""chat-jd""",24/24,4.0,984614400,Engaging page turner!,"The Scarletti Curse is the story of a young and very innocent healer, Nicoletta, who is chosen to stand beside a powerful Don, the Don Scarletti, whom even the king feared. The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's, where the women they love end up dead, and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die, including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer), herself, is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath), and the story developed from there, with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night, the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;, uncertain on what I would find. On one hand, she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her &quot;Dark&quot; series about the Carpathians. On the other, this was a non-Carpathian book, though a Gothic, so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here: Christine has hinted that Nicoletta and Giovanni have some relation to her Carpathian series. I look forward to her exploring that in more detail)I really hope that Christine explores Antonello's character. He was a secondary character and very mysterious, the only character that Christine did not explore in depth. He quite fascinated me. I would also like to see some explanation as to where Giovanni and Antonello got their telepathic abilities.Thank you, Christine! Keep up the great work, and I hope that the publisher will release a lot more books of your books A LOT faster, as I will buy every one."

She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders.

Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die, he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don'splitSize believe in giving too much information in a review so I won'splitSize say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings, the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives, and last but not least, the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant, but not overly so. He had a soft, gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance, at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince, another book I have by her."

Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine, for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide!"

Our dark hero is made from the same mold that created her Dark Series men: powerful, dark, serious, passionate, and ofcourse possessive. We love these traits, that's why we keep coming back for more! She has created a wonderful book that includes drama, horror (as in strange things happening at the palace), and passion. I thought it was a stimulating, and thought-out plot with tense scenes that keeps you engrossed. The growing attraction and passion between the two main characters leaves you wanting to read it again. If you are fond of Gothic authors, Victoria Holt and Dorthy Eden, you will love this book.

THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn'splitSize quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read."

Once inside those forbidding walls, she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark, brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own &quot;gifts&quot; and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy!"

So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality.

The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn'splitSize care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn'splitSize blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn'splitSize a bad book.

They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book ""Dark Symphony, in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia, suffering from food poisoning. While both ""healer"" and assistant do their work, Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta, asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says ""I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think""!A few days later the ""healer"" and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again, but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant, but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta, who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up, a few murders commited, the staff gossip, while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo."

There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

I was looking forward to the Scarleti novel as well. I was suprised at her change of writting style. I kept thinking I was reading a Ann Rice wanta be. The characters are now well drawn, Nicolette is weak, scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni &quot;tick&quot; he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanni,who is cursed, after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her, even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat, to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead, not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves, or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family &quot;curse&quot; for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book, it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don'splitSize remember what all else, and she did not develope her characters."

Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting, sensuous, just flat out stunning way. This book, though not about the vampire-like beings in her others, adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing, and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting, and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited, naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing."

Once again this incredible author did not dissapoint. I was riveted from page one! This is an author that not only yanks you into the story with a fascinating plot and incredibly descriptive detail (I actually got chills and the hair on my arms raised while I walked through the Palazzo with Nicolletta), but her characters become a part of you.

Not just finding them interesting, amusing, wonderful and touching, but really caring about them, as though they were actual people, a part of my life.

The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself, she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately, the one man she wishes to hide this talent from, Giovanni Scarletti, is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work, the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine, it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with &quot;Lair of the Lion.&quot; This novel is much, much better.

Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However, the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass, suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies, but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale, this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her ""Dark"" series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner"

Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed, and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed, the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta, a woman who is known to be &quot;different&quot; in her gifts to heal, to listen to the wind, to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride, Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her, but when she fled her home to hide, the don followed her, luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice, erotic and seductive, entices her imagination and her womanhood, linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife, as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work, I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions, and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style, a deep understanding for history, and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism, THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning, including the dark castle with gargoyles, warnings from natural elements, portents from ravens, secret passageways, family secrets, and multiple dead wives. Further, the strong heroine isn'splitSize too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings, while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow.

The plot was good, the hero and heroine were a good match, but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother, my mother, my father, my grandfather, my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian.

Obviously this book is part of the required reading. It is a 'standard' work by which I mean that it and a few others are considered to be baseline, required reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the elementary level in the field of hermeneutics.That said, I give it four stars because it is definitely not accessible by everyone. It is written for people who have a serious goal in mind and a disciplined study habit. It is not ""easy reading"" though it is well worth the effort. Further it is much more beneficial to those who have at least a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew & Greek. In my class there are those who are entry level students (or auditors) who do not meet these criteria and I require them to read Berkhof but I augment the course with other books (""Reading the Bible With Heart & Mind"" by T. Longman, for one). This helps them advance with what they can get from Berkhof and reminds the more advanced students of their need to remain devotional in their Bible studies also.All in all, highly recommended for any reader as long as they understand what they are getting. You will be introduced to the various historical approaches to Biblical Interpretation (there are more than one you know), a sketch of a critique for each and a solid outline of how to build a more carefully crafted understanding of what the Bible teaches in your own reading."

More so in PC's case than in other authors who continue with the same character, book after book. This is because PC does the impossible, she keeps her characters continually growing with each story. Pass one up and you miss some of their development and the very interesting, but very flawed people that walk through the pages of her books are like people we know, friends, and one should stay current with one's friends.""Cruel and Unusual"" opens with Kay waiting for the execution of murder/rapist Ronnie Joe Waddell, but even as she's waiting someone is being killed, the killer using Waddell's M.O. One of his finger prints even shows up at one of the crime scenes.This book has the usual Cornwellian twists and turns and as usual I was glued to my seat as I read this five star novel. I loved every second of it, because nobody does Cornwell, like Cornwell."

Then experience had become my mentor, wiping its feet on that pristine part of myself that was idealistic and analytical. It is disheartening when a thinking person is forced to admit that many cliches are true. There is no justice on this earth. Nothing would ever undo what Ronnie Joe Waddell had done."" (p. 6)Scarpetta is a the medical examiner and Waddell, recently executed inmate, is her latest case. The Waddell case won'splitSize be so easy, and it turns out his prints are showing up at crimes during and after his execution. Was the wrong person executed? Waddell's prints are in ""the system"". Speaking of systems, who broke into Scarpetta's computer? And why are her two employees, Ben and Susan, acting strangely? On top of this, Scarpetta has to ""babysit"" her sidekick and her niece. Her sidekick, Pete Marino, is a cop who can'splitSize get over the end of his marriage. With bad health habits and a sour disposition, Scarpetta has to constantly remind Marino to watch out for himself. And her niece, Lucy, has gone from being a fat little kid to a thin, super intelligent math and science whiz. Lucy is now a bratty 17- year old with a terrible attitude. But hey, she can help Scarpetta with the computer, so it's worth having Lucy around! (I think Lucy is supposed to be annoying- it makes her more realistic.)So, it appears Scarpetta has to figure out why Waddell's prints are appearing at new crimes and why other people are being murdered. Simple enough, right? Yes, but it doesn'splitSize stay simple. Cornwell makes the plot extremely hole-ridden with little sidetracks. Scarpetta's missing her lover, Mark James. She's trying to make amends with flakey morgue attendant Susan Story. Professionally, Scarpetta's in A LOT of trouble, and the government nor the media will give her space. She also has to deal with the families of the deceased, who move in and out of the story, sometimes reappearing, and sometimes disappearing into thin air. These details bog down what could be an excellent thriller.What I do like - the vivid descriptions of Virginia winters. Completely spot on, and it makes me look forward to a break in my current sticky, summer weather. :)The medical procedures are described in detail - electric chair executions, autopsies, fatal gun shot wounds, etc.Again, though, Cornwell does ""too much of a good thing"" by getting overly technical with the description of Robyn Naismith's/Sam Potter's residence. As for the mysterious feathers, again, too much detail is given to the what, where, why and how's of orinthology. Too many pages devoted to the types of feathers in down. Bo-ring!This is an average read. I am not encouraging you to run to your local bookstore, because it would be a total waste of money. When you have time, and space on your library card account, check out this book. BUT, do not make it your first Scarpetta novel, because it will turn you away from the series!"

Jin,0/0,3.0,1273795200,"Excellent first half, unfocussed and over-the-top second half","'Cruel And Unusual' won Patricia Cornwell the CWA's Gold Dagger award, suggesting that those in the know regard it as her best Scarpetta book. I'm not so sure. The first half is excellent, raising the baffling and unsettling prospect of a killer committing murders from Beyond The Grave. But I feel the book badly loses focus in the second half, resulting in a rushed and somewhat anti-climactic conclusion.Note that this book sets up a story thread through the next two books, so you must read this before tackling 'The Body Farm' and 'From Potters Field'.To the story itself: convicted murderer Ronnie Waddell has just been executed. But when a young boy is found murdered in a strikingly similar fashion, Scarpetta, Marino and Wesley are forced to consider a number of disturbing possibilites. Is there a copycat killer? Or was the wrong man sentenced to the chair? This part of the book is well written, with a strong focus on the forensic science, as well as a study of Waddell himself and the crime he allegedly committed. But when another ""copycat"" killing turns up Waddell's fingerprint, things take a very bizzare twist.Here is where the book loses me. Instead of considering more logical possibilities about how a dead man's fingerprint might have got somewhere, Scarpetta and Co jump to the most extraordinary conclusion. The idea that Waddell could (a) convince another person to go to the chair for him, and (b) organise smuggling the imposter in and himself out, is ridiculous. Also, the latter part of the book is increasingly taken up with an investigation into Scarpetta herself, dragging her into court on the flimsiest of ""evidence"". Cornwell really lets her poor-woman-persecuted-by-evil-sexist-men theme go over the top here. Arrogant oaf Patterson may be, but to pin a multiple murder on Scarpetta? It's silly.The end result is that the conclusion to the book is incredibly rushed. It literally takes place within the last few pages, and is based on little more than a sudden hunch from Scarpetta. Combined with the fact that the finale is deliberately open-ended, the whole thing comes across as a huge anti-climax. While it does provide the perfect lead-in to 'The Body Farm', as a stand-alone ending I can only remember how cheated I felt when I first read the book.So in all, a great beginning that's let down by a confused and unfocussed conclusion. The central plot is clever and the investigation is interesting, but it's disappointing Cornwell seems to lose the thread of the story badly in the second half.[3.5 stars]."

Driven by work, shattered by lost love, reaching for someone to bring her back to life emotionally ... her feelings may not be noble but they certainly seemed human to me. A powerful woman in a controversial, conventionally male field, and reviewers ask why so many people hate her? It seems very realistic that the head of a high-profile state agency would find herself with enemies. While I have no real criticism of this book, I do have a comment on the rest of the series. Part of why I enjoyed this one so much is Lucy. As the series progresses, Lucy's life gets so complicated and convulated and dangerous that it is her character, not Kay's, that strains credibility.

Evans,2/3,3.0,973814400,Really 3.5 stars...she has written better,"Although Ms. Cornwell is not my favorite forensic murder mystery author, I almost always find her stories entertaining and her books serve the necessary purpose of my being antisocial on the subway to and from work. Cruel and Unusual, however, was not her best piece by a longshot, but seemed to be more of a 'filler' segment in the ongoing saga of Kay Scarpetta, medical examiner extraordinaire. As a scientist and hopefully a doctor in the future, I find the tone of the author to be condescending to the average reader's knowledge of science and forensics in general, however. I think enough Discovery Channel crime shows would cover the same material she describes over and over again. In any case, it was an entertaining thriller, but I enjoyed Point of Origin and Black Notice more."

Very strange occurrences continue to happen, including the fingerprint of Waddell showing up in the next murder victim's home and a morgue supervisor being killed by the same gun that killed Eddie Heath.

It's interesting to see just how many questions about a crime that Scarpetta can answer (and you can keep up with) without overloading the reader's brain.

Smith,1/2,4.0,1073347200,Interesting book to read during the holidays!,"This is only the second of the author's &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; novels that I've read, and I wasn'splitSize all that impressed with _Postmortem,_ so I approached this fourth book in the series with some scepticism, even though It seems to be one of the best reviewed. After a decade of appeals, Ronnie Joe Waddell is finally being executed and Scarpetta waits to perform the autopsy (though I'm not clear why that should be necessary). But that same evening, a young boy is ritually murdered in a manner very reminiscent of Waddell's style. That's followed by another murder -- and Waddell's fingerprints apparently are found on the scene. Was someone else executed in his place? The authorities involved, of course, don'splitSize even want to *think* about such an appalling possibility. More murders follow, including Scarpetta's own Morgue Attendant, and suddenly links seem to be turning up to tie the Chief Medical Examiner to the killings, as well as to corruption in her own office. All the action takes place in the few weeks preceding and following the Christmas-New Year's holidays, and the gray, cold winter adds greatly to the flavor of the narration.There's no question that this one is an improvement over the first one I read. Cornwell doesn'splitSize bring in a completely new character in the last chapter to be the villain, for one thing. And she has added considerable depth to the personalities of all the repeating characters, especially Lt. Pete Marino of Richmond Homicide and FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley. My favorite, though, is Lucy, Scarpetta's niece from Miami, who possesses what another character calls a &quot;frightening intellect.&quot; But she's still seventeen years old, and her home life is, in many ways, not a happy one. Aunt Kay really does try to be the friend and confident to Lucy that she would like to be, but she has her own emotional problems -- not least among them the death of her lover in an IRA bombing in London less than a year before -- and her naturally reserved and somewhat stony personality is sometimes her own worst liability.There are problems, though. Cornwell has a rather pompous style, especially when she's describing the latest crime-fighting technological advances, or the ins and outs of UNIX. It's as if she enjoys saying &quot;I know more about this than you do.&quot; She also indulges in irritating word-choices, such as not knowing the difference between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; (e.g., &quot;I put my revolver inside my purse&quot;), and she seems to be unaware of the use of contractions in ordinary speech. Still, the well thought out plot and the complications in possible motives and interpretations kept me reading. Many fans and reviewers take it as a given that Cornwell is the &quot;best&quot; mystery writer working, which I can'splitSize agree with at all. But she's not bad."

In that sense it was a really good read and delivered the suspense it promised. I usually enjoy Patricia's books and like the way she builds a profile of her heroine's life, including the people she is close to as well as those more on the periphery of her life - it helps the reader to relate to her and treat her as a real person. I particularly like the way she combines her professional life with her personal one and think it shows the human side which is very necessary considering her profession which could otherwise seem very detached and clinical so well done for that consideration. The plot was complex but not too much so and very cleverly thought out. The only reason I didn'splitSize find it unputdownable was because for me the over usage of technical jargon got in the way too much. Most people not familiar with the terminology will probably find it irritating - after all, who wants to have to refer to a medical directory to understand what's being said! I have heard many others make a similar comment but personally I never found it a bother in her other books but on this occasion I was quite exasperated.

""villagebookreview""",0/0,3.0,1306281600,Dissatisfying,"Ronnie Joe Waddell, who's been on death row for nearly a decade for a vicious murder, is executed, and Kay Scarpetta is called on to perform an autopsy on his body. At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can'splitSize help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn'splitSize seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration. Overall, Cruel and Unusual works as a crime novel, but still leaves the reader somewhat dissatisfied at the end."

Cruel and Unusual is one of the best in the series in my opinion. I say this because Cornwell is at her best when she quietly piles on the tension factor. Cornwell at her worst is when she feels the need to multiply the body count via the worlds evilest serial killer ala James Patterson. Sadly, after 'Cruel and Unusual', Cornwell starts in on several books that just go further and further out on a limb of insanity. Happily for you the reader, if you have not read this book yet, you are in for a very entertaining yarn from Cornwells best period.The plot here is fairly complicated and its hard to describe much of it without giving away some of the earlier surprises. So I will suffice to say that it starts out when Scarpetta is called in to do an autopsy on a recently executed death row inmate. However, it quickly becomes apparent that something is not quite right. A couple of days earlier a young lad had been killed in much the same manner as the death row inmate and soon it looks like the executed man somehow might not have been the right person put to death. Instead the death row guy might be out on the street knocking off victims once again. How did this happen?Also, Scarpetta is dragged into a series of questions to answer when files start to go missing in her office and something or other is amuck.I hope you read this book.

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),,A3MPV6UPZ3LLAM,K. N. Nelson,0/1,4.0,1133395200,Lots of loose ends.,"I really like both this author and her popular heroine Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of the maturity of the character in addition to the stoicism that is displayed by her cool and collected manner. She is the ultimate professional. This book ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not up to the author's personal standards set in other books such as ""Trace"" which is one of the very best she has written to date.I have spent the past 10 minutes rereading parts of this book and am still confused by the mishmash ending. I don'splitSize have a real clue what happened to the bad guys here. Where is the ravening beast convict who was released from prison and resulted in a number of unsolved murders as one example? There is a lot of personal stuff to soften and ""humanize"" the image of Dr. Scarpetta, but even with the snarky neice Lucy with her smart alecky mouth, there is still the steely and distant feel to Dr. Scarpetta. I like that a lot.IMO, the absolute worst thing an author can do to a strong female character is to make her suddenly get ""melting bones"" or those insipid hormonal storms, a la the Nora Roberts style, et al, that stimulate their ""broody"" instincts at the first sight of an acceptable male and the next topic becomes gooey babies and sucky conversations with relatives rather than science and focus and dedication to one's career that makes for a tight, fascinating and worthwhile read.So, with that in mind, this book gets a 4 pointer simply because Ms. Cornwell avoids the ""romance-crime drama"" pitfalls and forges ahead with a decent, albeit patchy and vague story. I am glad that the author has also forged ahead in her craft and her subsequent stories are sooooo much better than this one."

Then, after the death of her assistant, Susan Story, Kay becomes implicated in the crime. Can she discover the true killer before she ends up either in jail or dead herself?What I Liked:First off, I enjoyed Cornwell's writing style. She writes with intelligence and detail, brining you into the very scene. The autopsies, the attention to detail (particularly in relation to Eddie and Jennifer), the thorough regard for the scenery all made it very easy to transport myself to Virginia with Dr. Scarpetta.Further, the story was pretty interesting and left you guessing. When I opened the book, I would have had no clue of the outcome, which was surprising (if, in a sense, a little disappointing as well). Several seemingly unrelated people die, but somehow Cornwall is able to tie their deaths in at the very end.My favorite characters included Benton Wesley, Marino, and, of course, Kay. Benton was an intelligent man, kind and someone Kay could turn to. But he almost held an aristocratic air. Marino, on the other hand, was more down to earth. I enjoyed his arguing with Lucy and how the gruff man ended up coming to Christmas to Kay's after all. Finally, I grew fond of Kay. At first, I found her hard to approach, but then I realized that was her personality anyway. As the story progressed, I felt I got more of a handle on who she was and what she wanted. Further, I enjoyed how she paid attention to detail and thought things through logically.What I Did Not Like:Now, this could be due to my taking a month longer than I should have to finish this book, but I felt the story was slow (but not in an obvious ""Will this book ever end?"" fashion). I was plugging along and realized, ""Hm, I'm halfway through and still have no clue how the heck this is going to end"". This is not necessarily bad, but I would certainly not classify this book as one of those racing thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat every moment.My biggest complaint has to be the character of Lucy. She is probably the most annoying character in the book. Her selfish, bratty whining made me wish frequently she would go home. Her actual purpose in the book was so small, I have no idea why she was included for most of it! All she did was discover the message left in Kay's computer and that AFIS had been corrupted. I felt that Cornwall was repetitively shoving Lucy away because she was in the way (sending her to ski with Benton's wife, having her left home alone while Kay ran around doing errands, etc.). And I have a hard time believing that a 17 year old could be such a computer brainiac. I think the story would have been much better without her.Lastly, I felt the ending was rather rushed, the story concluding rather hastily in the last 10 pages or so, almost as if Cornwall was being pushed to get the story done and hurriedly threw the last bits together.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Dialogue is relatively tame, considering the genre. A few d***, h***, ba*****, and some wandering appearances of the f-word.Lucy complains about her mother's promiscuity and asks Kay if her aunt will have an affair. Kay's lover is brought up. Marino goes home with a woman after a Christmas party.Finally, three people are killed in the course of this book (well, more if you count Waddell, the death row criminal, and his victim). The autopsies describe the injuries, which can make the squeamish squeam. Also an explosion is described in retrospect.Overall:My first thought at finishing this is ""Ho-hum"". ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not really a bad book. It is well written and fairly interesting. I just felt that parts drug more than they should and really couldn'splitSize stand certain nameless (LUCY!) characters. 3 stars.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*"

The book is a must-read for those addicted to Cornwell's well-researched suspense novels, since it sets the stage for a showdown in From Potter's Field. But a major plot hole revealed in the first few pages leaves the reader feeling cheated for the remainder of the novel.We enter the story with Scarpetta recovering from the death of a close friend. While this development certainly bodes well for future plot twists, it leaves the reader frustrated with the current one. The few details of the death surface mostly at the end of the story and while we're told of Scarpetta's devastation, we really don'splitSize witness it.

A death row inmate, Waddle, is executed, but before his body is even cool, murdered corpses start piling up with Waddle's fingerprints found at the scene of the crime. Next thing you know, people are dropping like flies, some of them close to Dr. Kay, and she is publicly implicated in the deaths.Cornwell has written a workably entertaining mystery here. The plot is engaging and bubbling with intrigue, and the writing isn'splitSize hampered by too much extraneous detail or incidental goings-ons. There is a subplot with Kay's niece, Lucy, that I found a tad ingratiating and annoying, but for anyone reading the Scarpetta mysteries in order, it is an understandable and rather necessary bit of character development.I do, however, object to Cornwell relegating some of the more serious character development to the back story. I'm talking about the sudden death of Kay's long-time love interest, Mark, (and, to a lesser extent, her decision to quit smoking). These are pretty significant events in Kay's life, and to leave them in the background as part of the story dressing seems at odds with an author who wants us to sympathize with her character.To that end, some of the story ended up either ringing false to me, or just falling flat. For example, there is much made of Kay's financial secrets, which she refers to in connection with embarassment and rage. When the secrets are finally revealed, I found them to be maudlin and a little silly. It baffled me why Kay would take such pains to keep them hidden.Furthermore, I respect Cornwell's decision to keep her novels secured solely in the Holmesian realm of mystery solving, but this means that there is very little action in the book, and a lot of key details are discussed and reviewed over and over again by the characters. It makes for repetitive reading. It also means that the actual discovery of the culprit's identity is never as important as the sleuthing that went into discovering that identity.In other words, if you're looking for closure with this story, you won'splitSize get much. Cornwell does a great job of setting up quite a puzzler, and it will keep you guessing. But, much like a magician with an amazing magic trick, once you learn the secret, you're bound to be a little disappointed."

This is my fifth Patricia Cornwell book, but definitely is not my favorite. The plot was terrific--the idea of a death row inmate possibly escaping from prison is a frightening concept, especially since Cornwell is always right on the ball when it comes to accuracy of details. As always, the characters are so realistic that the reader often must test himself to remember that they are indeed fictional. This book got a five star rating from me until about halfway when political injustices against the main character intervened. Although this was a good idea for a plot twist, it seemed that Cornwell was digressing from the main idea of the story, taking the reader into another story completely separate from what we read in the beginning. The ending was a disappointment--throughout the story, Cornwell is setting the reader up for the usual great climax where the perpetrator is discovered and captured and all is well--and then, it doesn'splitSize happen. In my opinion, it seemed like the ending was written by not Cornwell, but another author who rushed to complete this chapter of Kay Scarpetta's adventures as soon as possible. Overall, Cruel and Unusual was a good book that unfortunately could have been a great book if the right elements had been present."

The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."

An executed inmate's fingerprints turn up at another crime scene. How could this possibly happen? Perhaps he's still alive, having been switched with another inmate instead of dying himself. Perhaps the truth is more twisted and harrowing than even Dr. Scarpetta can imagine.

I have read two others (Cause of Death and Black Notice) before this one, but this is my favorite of the three. Cruel and Unusual contains elements found in the other Scarpetta novels (difficult conversations with her mother and sister, major neuroses revolving around her niece, Lucy, internal plots hatched to ruin Scarpetta, and expecting Pete Marino to drop dead from his excesses at any second), but not to the point where I found the repetition annoying. If anything, I want to see more of these familiar characters. The autopsy details seemed less excessive and the pace was quicker.Cruel and Unusual begins with the execution of a rapist/murderer, and the following autopsy of the felon. Shortly thereafter, a string of seemingly unconnected murders erupt around Richmond. Scarpetta finds one common strand - all appear to be committed by the supposedly dead convict. As if this isn'splitSize bad enough, her assistant is murdered and the press indicts Scarpetta.As always, Cornwell's knowledge of forensic medicine and the law were put to good use.

B000890HE2,Gaston de Blondeville (The modern novelists),,AVRVACFKJ5QMM,"Tyler R. Tichelaar ""Tyler R. Tichelaar, Ph.D....",12/12,5.0,1184112000,Mrs. Radcliffe: First Lady of Historical Fiction,"Valancourt Books' recent publication of Mrs. Radcliffe's Gaston de Blondeville is a publication long overdue. The novel, originally published in 1826, three years after the mistress of the Gothic's death, was actually written by her in 1803, but then suppressed by her from publication. The general belief is that she disowned the novel, thinking it inferior to her other work; literary historians have also claimed that readers agreed and greeted its publication with little enthusiasm. The primary reason usually given for why it is inferior is that it is the only one of Radcliffe's Gothic novels where she chose to use a real ghost rather than explain what appeared to be supernatural occurrences. The general reader, and especially the student of Gothic and historical fiction, should be allowed to judge the matter for himself and now that Valancourt Books has republished Gaston de Blondeville, that decision can be made.Gaston de Blondeville, while admittedly not as full of chills and suspense as The Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, is a remarkable novel in Radcliffe's canon. It marks a noted departure from her earlier novels, and in many ways, it displays her growth and restraint as an author. Considering all her previous novels were published between the time she was twenty-five and thirty-three, a remarkably young age for someone to write three of the greatest Gothic novels of all time, as well as a couple inferior ones, it is not surprising that Radcliffe sought to move in a new direction in her work. Gaston de Blondeville was the beginning of her growth in that new direction, and had she written another like it, readers may have had a real treat in an even greater Radcliffe.My only criticism of Valancourt Books' edition of Gaston de Blondeville--which is filled with a superb collection of secondary sources and an impressive scholarly introduction by Frances Chiu to reflect the historical and political influences of the French Revolution upon the novel--is that no attempt is made in these supplementary materials to explain why Radcliffe made this departure from her past use of rational explanations for supposed supernatural occurrences. I believe that departure is the big question that must be answered about this novel, especially since Radcliffe was otherwise striving to be more realistic from a historical standpoint.Despite what is typically said about Gaston de Blondeville by literary historians, the six contemporary reviews provided in this edition are largely favorable. In her introduction, Frances Chiu quotes these reviews to argue that literary critics condemned the novel, but in truth, only one review is solidly negative while the rest express great enthusiasm for a new work by Mrs. Radcliffe. Chiu quotes La Belle Assemblee as saying ""it is without the lofty pretensions of some of Mrs. Radcliffe's earlier productions, and incapable of exciting an equal intenseness of interest"" but Chiu fails to quote what comes directly after: ""it will not in the slightest degree detract from the fame of her"" and ""it will be read with great satisfaction by every reader of taste."" Scots Magazine was pleased that the novel does not include so much of her poetry which is not remarkable at all, and overall feels the novel is an improvement on her earlier work because ""She avoided long particulars of rural scenery, and tedious trackings of the agitated mind, from one terrible or sorrowful imagination to another."" In fact, the only review that is truly negative is the Monthly Review, which does find parts of the work to praise but chiefly objects to its use of the supernatural.Why Radcliffe decided to include supernatural events as a reality has not been given a good explanation. Perhaps she felt the supernatural was more acceptable to the reading public by the earlier nineteenth century, nearly fifteen years after she wrote her first Gothic novel. While she may have been in competition with other Gothic writers, her contemporaries, such as Matthew Lewis in The Monk (1795) and William Godwin in St. Leon (1799), were not beyond using the supernatural as a possibility, so perhaps she need no longer provide rational explanations for supernatural events. Greater study is needed of how the view toward the supernatural changed and became acceptable in literature, especially during this period as the ""Age of Reason"" was replaced by the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.What I find more remarkable about Gaston de Blondeville than Radcliffe's use of the supernatural is that it is one of the earliest historical fiction novels. Sir Walter Scott is often credited with being the first major writer of historical fiction, but historical fiction certainly has its roots in Gothic novels with their typically medieval settings. The difference between Gothic and historical fiction is the concentration on a much more realistic historical world. The Gothic typically sets its novels in a more vaguely historical period or avoids attention to historic detail. A key component to historical fiction is the depiction of historical events and historical personages in the background of the novel, such as the Battle of Culloden as the background to Scott's Waverley (1814). If that is true, then I would argue that Radcliffe is our first true female historical novelist since Gaston de Blondeville, although not published until 1826, was written in 1803, a full six years before Jane Porter's The Scottish Chiefs (1809), that tremendous novel about Sir William Wallace, and only three years after Godwin's St. Leon (1799) which only really attains historical fiction status due to its including the historical character of Bethlem Gabor in its pages. (Arguments have been made that Clara Reeve is the first female writer of historical fiction, but I don'splitSize feel her work is historically detailed enough to merit such a claim). Radcliffe is far more historically detailed than Godwin in her descriptions of the court of Henry III and in the details she provides of that age of chivalry, tournaments, and medieval monasteries. While her novel may not have had the influence on historical fiction that Scott's works did, and therefore, she may not be the mother of historical fiction, not having led to the birth of similar historical works, as she was for Gothic novels, she certainly is the aunt, who has been kept like a skeleton in the closet, while Gaston de Blondeville has been treated as if it were better not to be talked about it, lest it ruin the Mistress of Gothic Literature's good name.I encourage all lovers of Gothic and historical fiction to read Gaston de Blondeville to make up their own minds. I personally find the novel a much more concise, controlled and mature work, and if not as fascinating and suspenseful as her previous works, one that deserves further attention. If Mrs. Radcliffe had written and published a couple more historical novels after Gaston de Blondeville, I have no doubt she would have rivaled Sir Walter Scott for his dominant place as a writer of historical fiction. As always, I commend Valancourt Books for preserving our literary heritage by printing such important and overlooked works of literature.- Tyler R.

But the joyous mood is interrupted when a merchant, Hugh Woodreeve, comes distraught before the King to demand justice. His kinsman, he claims, was murdered, by the very man the King has come to honour -- Gaston de Blondeville!Suspecting a conspiracy against Gaston, yet obliged to hold a trial to determine the truth of the allegations, Henry imprisons Woodreeve in a tower while awaiting a hearing. Meanwhile, sinister forces are at work, represented by an evil abbot, who will stop at nothing to ensure the truth behind Woodreeve's claims is never revealed.As the trial unfolds and the danger mounts for both Woodreeve and Gaston, a mysterious figure will come from beyond the grave to elucidate the horrible mystery!The only one of Radcliffe's novels to feature a real ghost, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This edition, the first-ever scholarly edition of the novel, features a new introduction by Frances Chiu, uncoding the novel's long-hidden political, historical, and religious contexts.

However, the tale goes much further than exploring the cat's desire to anthropomorphise. It deals with father-daughter relationships, love, obedience, the stiffling influence of tradition, clashes between cultures, etc. It is uniquely influenced by Jewish theological exegesis and rabbinical commentary. Moreso than Will Eisner's work which was a landmark in this area (also on Amazon).I liked the artwork in the main. Panels are loosely framed on the pages which gives a light flow to the narrative. Colours are strong and mediterranean when needs be. I have two reservations however. Firstly, some of the pieces are overdrawn. Too much unnecessary detail in a scene. Text in the speech bubbles is squeezed at times and as a middle aged person with spectacles I found it hard to read on occasion. My reading wuld have been easier if overall frame size was bigger. Secondly, and this is my major reservation, the whole tale is told primarily through language used by the characters rather than through the characters actions. In other words as a graphic novel, I thought it was too wordy. You may well observe, that it is ironic that a graphic novel based around the culture of the 'people of the Book' repeats the textual propensity of much Jewish self-commentary. Eisner, to my mind, has the text-visual balance better defined. However, these are personal aesthetic opinions and shouldn'splitSize detract from the overall conceptual achievement which is exemplary."

This novel was originally published in France, in three volumes, spread over three years. It's a wonderful book.By the way, Joann is a guy's name, in France. Maybe, it's an old French spelling of John or Jean. According to the book's jacket blurb, Sfar is one of the ""brightest and most talented of the younger generation of French comic artists."" He has written or collaborated on over one hundred books for adults & children. Sfar received the prestigious Jury Award at Angouleme for The Rabbi's Cat.This book will be enlightening for most people & especially for most Jewish-Americans. The three connected stories are about Algerian Jews in the 1930s, in both Algeria & France. My knowledge of this area of Jewish life & history is negligible. IThe cat in this book gains the power of speech by eating & swallowing the family's pet parrot. The cat ends up having theological & philosophical discussions with the Rabbi. The cat wants to study Kabbalah & get Bar Mitzvahed. They debate both Western thought & Jewish thought.Through the cat's eyes we listen in on the discussions of the Rabbi's students. We learn who are studious & who are vain, arrogant & self-important. We see the Rabbi turn to his own Master with his problems; but, through the cat's eyes we see this Master as less knowledgeable than his disciple. We see a Master who spouts foolishness because he knows of his own inferiority.We learn of the anti-Semitism faced by Jews in Algeria from the non-Jewish French settlers. Many of the Jews had been living in Algeria for centuries & had adopted Arab dress, food & customs. These Jews were turned away from French restaurants & other establishments. They usually felt more at home with the native Algerians; yet, always faced an undercurrent of nonacceptance. Even the French-Jewish establishment, centered in Paris, forced the leaders & Rabbis of the Algerian Jewish community to adapt to French ways, customs & speech. If such leaders & Rabbis couldn'splitSize pass demeaning grade school exams showing proficiency in French, they would be replaced; even though all native Algerian Jews spoke Hebrew & Arabic which had enabled them to get along quite well for those previous centuries.Through the cat's eyes we see the title Rabbi's struggle for acceptance by the French Jewish establishment. He is a great man in Algeria & is being considered for the post of Chief Rabbi. First he must pass this silly grade school exam. Readers see his agony & self-doubt. We see his complete joy at passing the exam & his own humbleness.We see friendship between himself & his Arab friends. We learn about Algerian Jews who have gone totally native, living like Nomadic warriors in the desert; at home with guns, knives & lions. We learn about the differences between Algerian Jews & French Jews in the pre-WWII period. We learn about street performers & Algerian Jews who must masquerade asArabs to make a living in France; as the French know almost nothing about Jews from Algeria who live like Arabs but are Jews.It's a wonderful book. There is much to learn about love, loyalty, marriage, family, hypocrisy, bravery, humbleness, friendship, loss, merriment, true riches, anti-Semitism and more. All of this is contained within less than 150 pages of a graphic novel, or what the French call, an adult comic book."

I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare ""sacrilegious magic"" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide ""Chabad houses"" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements."

The lives of American, British, French, and Algerian Jews are all different. We can be found in the unlikeliest of places; Cuba, Mexico City, Rio, Mumbai, Dublin (I'm not joking, there are Jews in Ireland).I once boarded with a Jewish family in Strasbourg. Their lives were much different from those of New York Jews; they kept a lower profile, avoided gentiles, and their eating habits were more like those of their neighbors (no bagels, herring, or kugel on their table).

The Rabbis gorgeous daughter, having no interest in philosophy (and having no work to do) loves this cat as if he were an irritating younger sibling.Zlabya is your typical Arabian-Nights-Fantasy though she happens to be Jewish.

I ended up completely engrossed and read through them both in three nights.These books are for grown-ups, not children, although I understand Mr. Sfar also creates books for young readers. I love his drawings and panels. They're loose, energetic, rich in texture and color, and impart the feel of the settings and the life-force of the characters. The dialogue is lively and smart. There's a lot going on in these stories connected by the presence of The Cat. The story and environments change; sometimes the characters are excited and welcoming of the changes and sometimes not. I hated to see one story line end, but then the next one would pick up and I would be carried along by it engrossed and curious to see what happened next. It's a very human story set in a complex place and time. The characters struggle to keep their faith and balance in the midst of it all. They succeed, fail, learn, and are forged.And the cat is very, very true: smart, self-possessed, jealously devoted to his ""masters,"" and on equal or better intellectual footing compared to the human characters."

The cat is one of the most charming, insightful, and funny characters to appear since Philip Roth's more audacious characters. This book is both laugh-out-loud funny, sad, sardonic, and ultimately life-affirming. It is an extremely offbeat book - trying to describe it is almost impossible. You really have to see it to ""get"" it. Unfortunately, no preview pages appear on the site, because that would greatly help to convey the character of the book.To give you an idea: in the first section, the cat eats a parrot and gains the power of speech. He explores all of the things one can do with that: taunt, lie, blaspheme, and bait. The rabbi wants to teach him Torah, but he wants to learn Kabalah. The issue is brought to ""the rabbi's rabbi,"" where the cat informs him that:""I want to convert to Judaism.

He says that the love of God should be almost carnal. He tells me that it is an intellectual love but you should always feel as though you were cradled in the arms of a master who is invincible, benevolent, and just.I tell him that this is exactly what I feel for my mistress. ...I answer that he blasphemes, that my mistress is true.He says that only God is true.I say that God is a reassuring myth. I say that he doesn'splitSize have anyone to take care of him because he is old and his parents are dead.I say that I have my mistress and I will never be alone because I will die before she does. He throws my master and me out.""Couple dialog like this with the wonderful drawings, the cat's flashing green naughty eyes, the gentle rabbi and his beloved daughter, and you have an amazingly odd, touching, and engaging book.Be advised: this is not a children's book (although if you are liberal with your older children and don'splitSize mind them dealing with some adult themes, I'm sure a lot would love it). The themes are theology, faith, death, existential fear, love, religion versus secularity, jealousy, and even class differences in France.

When the cat eats a parrot, he gains the power of speech, only to lose it when he wants to break one of the ten commandments.There is a lot of religious details the author has provided, but for some reason he left out one rabbinic tradition, that of a wife cutting her hair when she marries.Another theme is the role ignorance of Kabbalah and Talmud play in religious circles.In summary, this book is a wonderful tale, but not meant for kids, due to some of the translated language."

They usually give me headaches, but this one revealed a quirky style and a refreshing lack of onomatopoeia in starbursts. It's so much easier to tell a good story when you're not constantly being interrupted by POW!! and ZOK!!! and the like.As a cat owner, I confess that it was the title that grabbed my attention, but I'm guessing that the plurality of cat lovers will not like the way the cat is drawn: Sfar's style sometimes reminds me a bit of Ralph Steadman's, and the cat's proportions change according to his mood and the context of the scene. Sfar focuses on intriguing details--a character might be drawn very sketchily in one scene, but some small object in the background will be meticulously rendered. In the next scene, the same character will fill the frame and be drawn with equal attention. This style works out perfectly for as mutable a creature as a cat.Format and style aside, the story is what really made me buy this book. The prose works just as it should with the illustrations, an aspect that I think some graphic novelists overwork, or ignore. As a fan of Issac Bashevis Singer, I was sucked in when the rabbi's initial response to his talking cat was ""Will he be a Jew?"" And, more importantly, ""Will he be a good Jew?"" (Not being Jewish, by the way, has not been an obstacle to enjoying the work of either author.)The book is divided into three separate stories, and while the first was my favorite, I also enjoyed following the cat and his rabbi as their family circle expanded to include an exotic friend with a lion (who gets along amiably with the cat) and a down-on-his-luck singer who has been reduced to belting out bawdy numbers on Sabbat.Like the very popular ""Persepolis"", this book has shown that graphic novels can be both funny and deep, and that they deserve to share shelves with the best non-graphic novels of our time."

What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now.

Jaszczak ""servant of the secret fire""",6/7,4.0,1135987200,Humorous and profound,"""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a sometimes humorous, sometimes profound graphic novel about an unworldly rabbi, his daughter Zlabya and her cat in early 20th century Algeria, as told by the cat. The cat gains the ability to speak by swallowing the family parrot, an act that he, of course, immediately denies. The conversations between the cat, the rabbi, and the ""rabbi's rabbi"" are some of the funniest parts of the book, but along with such questions as whether the cat should be considered Jewish or whether his age (for bar mitzvah purposes) should be calculated in human or ""cat"" years, is some serious and wide-ranging philosophical and theological discussion. What is a Jew? What does it mean to be created ""in God's image""? What is the difference between the cat's feeling for his mistress and the love of God? As a Reconstructionist I like the idea put forward by another reviewer of this being ""the first Reconstructionist cat."" And what other branch of Judaism would a cat choose?Eventually the cat pronounces the sacred name of God and loses his ability to speak, and from this point the book concentrates more on the relationships between human beings, although still from the cat's perspective. He experiences the pangs of jealousy when a young rabbi from an assimilated French family comes to their town and falls in love with his young mistress . He and his master then travel with the young couple to Paris to meet the groom's family, and must adjust to a very different kind of Jewish life before they return home to Algeria. On their journey they encounter several delightful minor characters, from the rabbi's cousin Malkah of the Lions (and his pet lion) to a cabaret singer in Paris.The Rabbi's Cat can be read on several different levels - as an entertaining ""talking animal"" story, an affectionate portrait of Sephardic Jewish culture, or a complicated story of human (and animal-human) relationships. Caution to parents: This book contains brief nudity and some mature language and themes."

Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria,"Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC."

""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a graphic novel set in Algeria in the mid 1930s. A poor rabbi lives with his lovely daughter Zlabya and their precocious gray cat. In over 850 marvelously-varied panels, author Joann Sfar tells the story of the trio as they deal with the cosmic questions of life, love, God's existence and fickle human nature. The story shuttles between sun-baked traditional North Africa and rain-drenched, cosmopolitan Paris. Sfar's palette ranges from the reds, oranges and yellows of the rabbi's home country to the muted blues, greens and whites of the Moroccan night and of the Parisian day.The book's characters are wonderful and complex. The old rabbi is kind, God-fearing and gentle, but fears being replaced by a more urban man who speaks French. His beautiful, young daughter, content to remain in her father's house, playing the piano and reading, also longs for love. The cat -- a cunning and shameless atheistic and opportunist -- gains speech, insists on being Bar Mitzvah and demands to learn the Kabala. He contends pointedly, if ignorantly, with the learned over theological questions -- all the while angling for a night on the prowl. There's also old and sinewy Malka of the Lions, striding manfully from the desert, toting an ancient rifle and accompanied by his faithful leonine companion. The book follows the characters through normal life events -- shopping, praying for the dead, washing dishes -- but touches on themes of death, hypocrisy, apostasy and man's relationship with a rather enigmatic and silent God. Using this humble cast, and in a medium not fully taken seriously by all, Sfar plumbs depths not normally plumbed by many serious works. Sfar's art is deceptively spare, but is always evocative and never dull. His message is one of optimism, delivered with humor and humanity.If this book were a film, I would rate it PG-13 for a small amount of nudity and vulgarity, and for the adult themes it explores."

Ross,8/13,3.0,1177891200,Too Aimless for My Taste,"I've long been a fan of the graphic novel, and I picked this one up mainly on the strength of its Algerian setting. Parents should take note: despite its somewhat children's bookish cover and title, this book is definitely intended for an older audience (there are some four-letter words and nudity), and the somewhat rambling narrative may well not hold the attention of teens.The story starts in colonial Algiers sometime in the 1930s, where we meet a humble widowed Algerian rabbi, his beautiful daughter, and their scrawny cat. The first third of the book concerns itself mainly with the rabbi and the cat, who, after eating a parrot, gains the ability to speak. Before long, the cat wants to learn about Judaism and convert, and starts asking all kinds of thorny theological questions. This leads to a pretty funny debate with the rabbi's mentor -- all of does a nice job of capturing the disputative nature of Judaism. (Those with a background in Judaism may well get a lot more richness and texture from this storyline than non-Jews like me.)This promising storyline is abandoned when the cat loses its power of speech, and the middle section segues into a somewhat meandering account of the rabbi's need to pass a French test in order to remain rabbi and a visit by the rabbi's dashing rural cousin. While this does a reasonable job of depicting the indignities of colonialism, there's not much else to this section. The arrival of a thoroughly urbane young rabbi from Paris propels the final third, as the beautiful daughter falls in love with, and marries him. The married couple and Algerian rabbi then visit the husband's family in Paris (with the cat tagging along). There, the rabbi has trouble coping with the cultural differences, and goes on a little adventure to track down a musician nephew, leading to even further indignities.I can'splitSize say I found the book nearly as delightful as most others seem to. Despite the running theme of faith, the narrative is altogether too disjointed to my taste, and despite bursts of jollity, the entire tone seemed rather wistful. The artwork is similarly impressionistic, with forms ranging from realistic to exaggerated to surreal. The palate is quite nice, as the natural earth tones of Algeria contrast vividly with the oppressive dreary grays and blacks of Paris. At times the panels get a little crowded by text though, and the entire book is a bit 'wordier"" than your average graphic novel"

The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."

Her story was heavily disputed by first the Secret Service who kept her in custody for hours on that fateful day, the CIA agent who was present in her first meeting with the FBI, and the FBI who interviewed her extensively for days after the assassination, as well as the Warren Commission's attorney who humiliated and intimidated her before taking her testimony for the Warren Commission.Some of the most interesting facts presented in this book are:1. Jean Hill saw Jack Ruby run at break-neck speed from the Texas Book Depository to the fence on the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting of JFK, as she ran towards the fence where she thought the shooter was.2. She saw a man in a Dallas-police uniform holding a rifle and standing behind the fence on the grassy knoll, immediately after the shooting, right before she was grabbed and escorted away by two Secret Service men.3. Her boyfriend was J.B. Marshall, the Dallas police officer who was on a motorcycle to the left rear of the president's car and who's helmet and bike got splattered with JFK's blood and brains. He told her that LBJ's Secret Service people instructed the motorcycle cops at the Dallas airport that these changes were being made: (a) the parade route was being changed to cut through Dealey Plaza on Elm Street; (b) the motorcycle cops would not be at the front of the presidential limousine as they normally would have been, but would only be at the rear of the presidential limousine; (c) the order of the cars in the motorcade was changed so that Johnson's car would not be immediately behind the presidential car, but that a carload of Secret Service would be in between the President's car and LBJ's car. Most shocking of all, was his report to Jean Hill that another motorcycle cop witnessed that LBJ started ducking down in his car at least 30 to 40 seconds before the first shots were fired.4. Arlen Specter, who questioned her in Dallas for the Warren Commission, was the one who proposed the &quot;single bullet theory&quot; that was adopted by the Warren Commission. His butchered transcript of her testimony to the Warren Commission was &quot;heavily edited, completely distorted and shamelessly fabricated.&quot;Author Bill Sloan does a credible job of telling Jean Hill's story and explaining her inner turmoil and emotional trauma about being a witness to the assassination. He explains about:1. Why she refused to go to Washington to testify before the Warren Commission.2. That she was romantically involved with a married man at the time (J.B. Marshall) and how he repeatedly tried to convince her to keep quiet about what she knew, and how he evidently knew more than he wanted to tell her.3. That the FBI kept her home under surveillance for 15 months after the assassination.4. Why she would not testify in the trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans, although J.B. Marshall and Mary Moorman did.5. Her eventual vindication and validation through experiences with Bill Marrs (author of Crossfire) who introduced her to others who witnessed the assassination, and her experiences with Oliver Stone and Kevin Cossner during the filming of the movie &quot;JFK.&quot;6. The details of the attempts on her life (most significantly, one almost-fatal car wreck caused by the steering-wheel bolts being unscrewed and another time when her car's brake-fluid line was found to be cut).The most inexplicable fact about Jean Hill's story is why was Jack Ruby running at break-neck speed towards the shooter behind the fence on the grassy knoll? She did not know who Jack Ruby was until she saw him on tv, as he shot Oswald. Her fear that no one would believe her about seeing Ruby running towards one of the shooters was increased when she was told by FBI agent Shanklin that eye witnesses had proved that Ruby was not at Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Perhaps her identification of Ruby at Dealey Plaza is the clue to why her testimony was distorted by the Warren Commission, why she was intimidated and humiliated, and why her story is so important. No doubt, historians, researchers, and future generations interested in finding out the truth about the JFK assassination will be grateful that Jean Hill's story is finally available in this book, published twenty-nine years after the assassination, without any distortion by those who would have preferred that it had never been told."

Brown ""CJB""",14/15,4.0,1143590400,So Jean Hill is no John Dean,"Just some thoughts on Jean Hill and her book.The only book I've purchased and read so far regarding the JFK assassination that gives you an insight on how (in this case) one of the witnesses life was affected by being in Dealy Plaza on that fateful day.She like most of the witnesses in Dealy Plaza said that she thought the shots came from the 'Grassy knoll'. She was man handled by so-called 'secret agents' 'Magic bullet man' also grilled her about her affair with a Dallas motorcycle Cop. He also goaded her about the `White dog she saw' which turned out to be White toy given to Jackie.Jean and her young daughter were involved in a car crash, her Lover and a mechanic friend of his checked out the car and found that the track rod ends had come loose. They like any mechanical minded person came to the conclusion that the car had been tampered with. Track rod ends just don'splitSize come loose so easily, if they did cars by necessity would have radically different steering assemblies.If you believe as I do that the witnesses in the Plaza were correct in their recollections of where the shots came from and also in their contact with (according to the official report NON EXISTANT) Dallas cops and Federal \ secret officials just minutes after the tragedy, then there must have been a conspiracy.Some reviewers have described this book as nothing more than a novel, so I looked up the words definition in the 'Collins English dictionary'Novel: An extended work in prose, either fictitious or partly so.I see, it's a novel because some reviewers disagree with Jeans recollections or because her recollections changed over the years. SO WHAT. Most peoples recollections of their life experiences change over the years, does this mean all our memories can only be fit for a Novel rather than a autobiography No.Now to why I titled this 'So Jean Hill is no John Dean' (I could have replaced John Dean with Harold Weisberg or Cyril Wecht)During the Watergate scandal John Dean being Nixons Legal counsel was set up for a big fall however because he had a photographic memory he could recall incidents and conversations in great detail without wavering under cross examination he deflected the blame to Nixon's Front line and eventually to Nixon himself.Most of us (including Jean) haven'splitSize got that type of memory or fortitude.Jean Hill passed away in 2000, she was a primary school teacher. Whenever her young students asked her to tell her story of the assassination, which in their young eyes was a part of American social history, she was always struck by their reactions.Her story will have left an indelible memory on a good percentage of them. I am sure some of the students will continue the search for the truth.Jean Hill was just an ordinary mother and schoolteacher.Arlen Specter is a Senator & highflying lawyer.Only one of them is a great American in my book: Jean Hill R.I.P."

In my view, her EARLIEST account of the shooting (which has been recorded on videotape for all to watch and listen to over and over again) should be looked upon as the BEST account of what she saw that Friday afternoon back in '63.But nearly thirty years later -- after having served just months earlier as an official (but uncredited) ""technical adviser"" to Oliver Stone during the making of Stone's 1991 film ""JFK"" (coincidence?) -- Hill came out with this book, which claims she ""saw a man fire at President Kennedy from the grassy knoll"".Did Jean's memory suddenly improve greatly in the intervening years? Everyone reading this publication should at least pause for a few moments to consider that question.Another major piece of Jean Hill-created ""evidence"" that is easily knocked down is her ridiculous claim of having seen Oswald's murderer, Jack Ruby, racing across the grassy knoll at the exact time of JFK's assassination.Multiple witnesses can place Jack Ruby in the Dallas Morning News building at the precise time the President was being murdered. Ruby HIMSELF, in fact, admits to having been in the DMN building at the time of the assassination.Below is a portion of the verbatim testimony given by Jack Ruby to the Warren Commission on June 7th, 1964 (from the Dallas County Jail, where Ruby was being held after having been convicted on March 14, 1964, of murdering JFK's assassin, Lee Oswald):----------""I picked up the brochure that Friday morning {November 22, 1963}, and I also had business at the {Dallas Morning} News Building on Friday, because that is the start of the weekend, which is very lucrative, the weekend.""So I went down there Friday morning to Tony Zoppi's office, and they said he went to New Orleans for a couple of days. I picked up the brochure. I believe I got downtown there at 10:30 or 11 o'clock that morning. And I took the brochure and then went into the main room where we compose our ads. That is the sales room where we placed our ads. And I remained there for a while. I started to write the copy of my ad.""Well, John Newnam comes in, and evidently he took it for granted I finished my ad, and I don'splitSize recall if he paid for his ad, and suddenly there is some milling around. I think it was 12, or 15 minutes after 12, I don'splitSize recall what, but John Newnam said someone had been shot. And I am sorry, I got carried away. It is the first time I got carried away, because I had been under pressure. And someone else came running over and he said a Secret Service man was shot, or something to that effect. And I am here in the middle with John Newnam, because Newnam isn'splitSize paying any attention to anyone else, and there is a lot of going back and forth. So someone must have made a statement that Governor Connally was shot. I don'splitSize recall what was said. And I was in a state of hysteria.""----------Therefore, how is it even remotely possible for Jean Hill to have seen Jack Ruby on the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza at 12:30 PM when President Kennedy was being shot? Quite obviously, this is not possible.But Jean Hill and Oliver Stone (in his movie) would like to have people believe that Ruby was running around Dealey Plaza's grassy slopes at 12:30 PM on November 22, instead of where even Ruby himself admits he was at the time of the assassination (with gobs of witnesses to verify his story) -- and that's on the second floor of the Dallas Morning News building.Since this book came out in 1992, Jean Hill has passed away. She died in Dallas on November 7, 2000, at the age of 69.---------------------This book's subject matter can get you to thinking about other eyewitness accounts of the events in Dallas' Dealey Plaza (and the shooting of police officer J.D. Tippit in nearby Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, a mere 45 minutes after President Kennedy was gunned down).I'm guessing that in a conspiracy theorist's fantasy world the only people with bad eyesight, or the only people capable of making an error, are those witnesses who gave testimony damning to ""Saint Oswald"" -- E.G.: Howard Brennan, Domingo Benavides, Helen Markham, Ted Callaway, Jack Tatum, Virginia Davis, Barbara Davis, William Scoggins, Johnny Brewer, Warren Reynolds, L.J. Lewis, Pat Patterson, Harold Russell, Robert Edwards, Ronald Fischer, etc.But, if we're to believe the ""CTers"", those conspiracy-favoring witnesses like Jean Hill and S.M. Holland and Acquilla Clemmons, et al, were somehow born with unimpeachable ""Conspiracy-Noticing"" skills.Acquilla Clemmons' account of the J.D. Tippit murder is taken as Gospel by many a-CTer, despite the wholly-ILLOGICAL ""plot"" that she supposedly witnessed on Tenth Street that day.....I.E.:Having TWO killers conspire to commit the Tippit murder, even though the conspirators' #1 goal here is to FRAME JUST ONE SINGLE ""PATSY"" FOR THIS MURDER (namely someone called ""Lee Harvey Oswald"").Smart, huh?Let's use TWO killers (needlessly, of course, for a practically point-blank killing of a policeman, who was just inches from the gun of the killer), instead of just using our trusty, present-at-every-murder-Oswald-supposedly-ever-committed-in-his-life ""LHO Imposter"" to do the job.From what school for covert acts did these plotters graduate -- ""The Academy For Brain-Dead Conspirators""?Nobody could be as stupid and reckless as these November 22nd Plotters/Conspirators were said to have been (per CT-slanted versions of events). Not possible. And this recklessness extends far beyond just the Tippit murder scene as well. In fact, it applies ever more so to the JFK killing in Dealey Plaza.Example:WHY in the world would these professional killers even WANT to utilize THREE teams of assassins (as Oliver Stone claims in his movie), firing six bullets potentially into their one target (JFK) from a variety of different shooting locations, when the whole idea of this intricate, supposedly-well-planned ""plot"" is to frame just a single ""Patsy"" who is supposed to be located in the Book Depository? Did these conspirators deliberately TRY to make their assassination scheme as complicated and implausible as they possibly could? Seems like it.And yet Oliver Stone actually has people buying this stuff. Kinda sad, huh? I think so anyway.Well, anyhow, whatever you do, take the contents of this book with a very large-sized grain of salt. (That advice goes double, make that triple, for viewers of Oliver Stone's motion picture as well.)"

Dr. Scarpetta leaves her Superwoman cape behind in this novel as she does battle with her long time foe Temple Gault. Temple moves his murderous spree to New York City where he decides that his Christmas gift to the Big Apple (and Kay Scarpetta) will be to leave a dead, bald, unidentified homeless woman in the bowels of Central Park. He then sends messages through CAIN (the very computer system created to catch him) to taunt Kay and the FBI. He does a masterful job at eluding the police and the FBI - even going so far as to kill right under their noses. But even the most masterful of murderers has a weakness, and in this gripping novel light is shed on what, in the end, brings down the house that Temple built"

It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous.

I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author."
B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,,,4/14,2.0,939686400,"More of a &quot;yawn&quot; than a &quot;scream&quot;, really...","Usually I read &quot;general fiction&quot;, but I also like to read &quot;crime novels&quot; from time to time. Of course that good &quot;crime novels&quot; also qualify as literature. Take Graham Greene, for instance, or James Ellroy, the Tinseltown Dostoyevsky. Of course that it's a very tricky business, that of writing crime novels. And unfortunately, Ms. Cornwell's &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; falls a little bellow the mark.Let's take the character development, for instance. Or rather, let us not take it, since there isn'splitSize any. Scarpetta continues to be a paranoid b***h who simply cannot stop moralising for a second (I like strong women characters; unfortunately, this one is just irritating). Lucy, whose very existence should be considered a crime, manages to be more annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Gault barely manages to be ONE-dimensional, let alone be terrifying (he's about as scary as Dr.Evil from &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Minus the jokes.) Marino is his usual amusing cardboard self and everyone else is just walking backdrop.But let us forget character for a while. How about the plot? After all, a good plot can save a crime novel, can'splitSize it? Well, not always, but in this case there is no plot. None that Cornwell hasn'splitSize written before, that is. Think about it: someone is out on a killing spree, Scarpetta takes on the case, Scarpetta goes here and there and finally, some name is pulled out of the filofax and thrown into the page, only to have him/her shot dead (usually by Scarpetta) at the end. The only difference here is that this time we *know* who the killer is, so the plot becomes quite obvious after the first twenty pages! Not that there weren'splitSize enough intriguing possibilities around: say, what has the Army got to do with everything? Or who exactly is Gault's father? (It would be interesting if Cornwell did a &quot;Chinatown&quot; here - you know: the scene where Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) reveals who is the father of her daugther - and came up with some really nasty solution to the question of Gault's parentage. Instead, it appears that Peyton Gault's brother was shagging his wife - duh!) But unfortunately, none of this leads anywhere. The &quot;plot&quot; merely goes on undeterred in its path towards Trite-city, Predictable-land. The only thing that starts out by being vaguely arousing is the scene where Scarpetta meets the Gaults. We aren'splitSize usually treated to this kind of viewpoint in the over-simplistic Scarpetta novels, so my hopes were high. What a major disappointment, considering that that scene is handled with all the subtlety of a demolition ball wrecking a building. I know that scenes like that are very difficult to write, but surely Cornwell could have come up with something better? After some time I came to realise that the purpose of that scene was to remind us how much &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; was brilliant in its handling of the reactions of parents towards their wayward - or their lost - children.Also, since we are talking about Scarpetta meets the Gaults, let us pose a question: why, pray tell, is there no explanation concerning Gault's fixation on Scarpetta? And consider the following situation: two twin siblings, very similar genetic traits, very similar upbringing... so why was Jayne Gault such an angel and Temple Gault such a demon? Should we start calling for father Merrin here? (OK, so he snorts about six lines of coke a day, but so did Drew Barrymore before her reinvention and never was she seen indulging in a killing spree.) Also, if it was so obvious from such an early age that Temple Gault had some serious problems, why didn'splitSize his parents commit him to an institution? Did they hope that he would grow out of it? In a word, Conrwell's tidbits concerning Gault are pure and simply bizarre. It's so ironic that I re-read the brilliant &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith before I picked up &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; - what a glaring contrast. Gault the classical Anti-christ? Compared to the wonderfully textured Tom Ripley he is just a complete ninny.There were some other things that left some bitter aftertaste in my mouth, such as the ever-present pro-death penalty stance (alright, Patricia, we know what your opinion is... enough already, OK?) and characters being fans of Ayn Rand's books (eek!!!). But considering the former, doesn'splitSize Cornwell know that the US is the only industrialised Western country to still have the death penalty? (Here in Portugal we got rid of that *in the late 1800s*.) Doesn'splitSize she realise that her arguments either mean absolutely nothing to the other countries where this is being sold or simply irritate lots of people there (myself included)? Also, why does Cornwell insist in portraying Scarpetta &amp; mates as defenders of a featureless society against criminals that are portrayed as &quot;complete outsiders&quot;? Is she afraid to face the real texture of a corrupt society, such as in &quot;Seven&quot;, for instance, and deal with the underlying problems? Since crime has been a feature of almost all human societies from the dawn of time, how about devoting some pages to that issue, instead of brushing it under the carpet?But I see this is getting too long, and I believe that I have stated the reasons to why &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; was a complete waste of time and money. If you want to read an interesting crime novel - a *real* novel - from the female perspective, read &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;. If you insist in reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; go ahead, but don'splitSize say you haven'splitSize been warned. As for me, this was not the first Cornwell novel I read, but it will certainly be the last."

B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,A2QG5IM3G4RHL8,M. Griffith,2/3,2.0,1010102400,Not very much depth or substance to this one,"The house we stayed in for New Years had a ton of books on its shelves and since it was raining a lot we had plenty of time to read. I picked up this book New Years Eve and finished it New Year's Day. I chose it for a couple of reasons, first off I had just finished a historical book and it was time for something light and I had recently seen a 20/20 episode where Patricia Cornwell claimed to have solved the identity of Jack the Ripper. So I was intrigued. I like mystery and thrillers and I knew she had written a lot of books in the genre and my wife had read several of hers and liked them. First off I must say that Patricia was stretching the word per page ratio with this book. I was reading the hard cover edition and the margins were very wide and each paged ended like 3 inches from the bottom with some silly footer taking up a lot of space. Secondly and partially as a consequence it was a very fast read. Finally I would not recommend this book, but it was entertaining in some regards. I don'splitSize know about any of her other novel's (I think I will check out one more of her's as a fair shake, in particular there was one book that one a bunch of awards one year that looks promising) but I found this to be a weak example of the genre. Lets face it, in any genre there are real works of literature that are the top of that particular genre, say Tolkien in fantasy, I am not sure what is the supreme literary example of mysteries but whatever it may be this was a bland consume. I didn'splitSize really care for it much. It is basically your typical psycho serial killer vs. the ""law enforcement"" individual. In this case Cornwell's hero is a heroine, Kay Scarpetta and Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, for which I think she has earned a lot of interest. However for a thriller of this type I enjoy James Patterson's Alex Cross series much better."

Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are &quot;as pale blue as a malamute's&quot;, when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star."

I didn'splitSize like it. And i thought i might be in for a disappointing Cornwellian offering.My, was i WRONG.This book is yet another stunner. She has definitely veered away from the cunningness and cleverness which inhabited her first three books. But she more than makes up for it with a chilling plot and one of the most cold and clinical serial killers i have eve read of. Essentially, this is a serial killer novel, and as that it not especially original. But it is nonetheless a good one.Marino, Benton, Lucy and of course Kay are back again for another great read. Cornwell's writing is sharp and to the point, and keeps the you turning those pages. I can'splitSize really put my finger on a reason why, but from the first time i read a Cornwell book i feel in love with the way she writes. It's simply...wonderful. I can'splitSize get enough of it. It's no more literate than the next person's, but for some reason i just relish every sentence she writes.The plot here is sometimes scatty and random (as was Cruel and Unusual) but here, she pulls it off a lot better. I tend not to like books full of random killings, without rhyme or reason (yoo hoo, James Patterson, author of Violets are Blue, i'm talking in particular about you.), but here i really did. The randomness is chilling, and Tenple Gault is a super villain, who curdles the blood. He is just so...hateable. You loathe him absolutely. Especially when you find out how he treats his sister. You just hate him even more. With every part of i wanted him to die, die, die. It is hard to conceieve of anyone so cruel and horrifically terrifying than him. When Scarpetta talks to his parents, it's painful to read, even though it's fiction. It's an extremely moving scene, full of emotion. (As is the entire book.)This book moves along relentlessly to it's absolutely brilliant conclusion. It is the best conclusion she has penned yet, down in the bowels of the New York subway. Dark and frightening, she really brings over the atmosphere.I loved this book, as i have loved almost every single Scarpetta novel so far.The identity of the first victim should come as a real shock."
B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,A4KDYV44L0I0,Jenn McNeil,14/15,3.0,1052870400,The Life of the Chief Medical Examiner?,"I am currently taking a murder mystery class at my college. I have not read many murder mysteries before this class. We have read a variety of novels for this class, with the most number of novels by one author being three. The one Patricia Cornwell novel our class read is ""From Potter's Field."" I very much enjoyed this novel, though I think it should be considered a thriller instead of a murder mystery. The novel also had some hard to believe aspects about it, which were difficult for the members of my class to look beyond.Why should this novel be labeled a thriller and not a murder mystery? Well, the reader clearly knows who the murder is. Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical Examiner, has the feeling the murderer is her ""nemesis,"" Temple Gault with plenty of reason. The only mysteries are for her to prove Gault is the murder, identify the first body of the girl, ""Jane"" and of course to find Gault, before he finds her. A thriller is also more appropriate because it had several moments that were extremely suspenseful, the kind that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. There is a section of the novel where there is a murder in Kay's office building and she believes the killer is still in the building. As she walks around the building, you expect Gault to jump out at any moment. There is also another section in which a trap is set for Gault in NYC's subway system. Not knowing whether or not he'll show up had me on the edge of my proverbial seat.As much as I liked this novel, there were several things that irked me about it. A Chief Medical Examiner seems more like an office, administrative position than a really, REALLY hands on job. Kay almost takes on the role of a detective. I could almost believe her occasional tasks of doing autopsies, but to travel to see a suspect's family seems over the top. Cornwell tried to combine too many types of people into just one character. Kay is the Chief Medical Examiner, technician, administrator, loving aunt and family member (sister and daughter), mistress, detective, seemingly EVERYONE'S friend, CIA/FBI associate, and still has time to be the nemesis of a serial killer. How the woman has time to eat is beyond me. Cornwell also did not take the time to really develop Kay as a character. It is far more difficult for a writer to show you what someone is like opposed to telling you information. Cornwell clearly is a teller, hence the really wordy and winded sections of the novel. This writing style is not as affective in writing a believable novel.I did find a unique aspect of the novel for me, personally. I'm from NYC and grew up there. I really could visualize the sections of the novel that described Central Park, the Museum of Natural History and the subway area at the end. It just added a realistic element to the novel that initially bought my interest in it.Overall, the novel's plot flowed for me, even with the occasional extremely unrealistic sections and poor writing. The ending was a big let down for me, but decide for yourself. If you're looking for a thriller with entertaining potential, give this Cornwell novel a try."
B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,A20RPFDSQBHJ26,director man,4/4,2.0,1137196800,Very Dissapointing,"From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel."

I was half way through the first chapter when I went back to the store and bought all the books in the series that came before. This is the best there has been.

Kay's affair with Benton is disappointing to me since she seems to pride herself on ""doing the right thing."" Lucy was insufferable in this one. She was younger in ""Cruel and Unusual"" and I could overlook her idiosyncracies, but she's older now and needs to get a grip - she almost seems to resent or dislike Kay at times but then turns around and loves her again. Also, Lucy's genius IQ and role as an FBI computer program writer who busts crime with her keyboard are beyond corny.The best part IMO was the scene in the morgue, as others have said. I don'splitSize think I would have been able to put the book down if a tornado had ripped through my house while I was reading that part!It is difficult to believe that a crazy guy high on cocaine most of the time could always be one step ahead of the police and FBI, brutally murdering people right under their noses and getting away with it.But then the worst came. The ending. Wham, bam, it's over, with Temple Gault's fate implied but none of the juicy details I was hungering for.

But I don'splitSize like Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta stories. It's very hard to differentiate between her characters, and the &quot;surprise ending&quot; leaves the reader feeling cheated, as there is no development leading up to the conclusion. One feels as if one has read a several hundred page prologue to a short story. Instead of character development, we are treated to the condition of the women character's breasts (perky, upright, sagging, fat) and just how much the male characters smoke.The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is hugely judgemental, frighteningly paranoid, and irritatingly egotistical. The story grinds to a halt here and there as Kay spouts off yet another moralizing homily about the right to privacy (except when SHE needs information), the right to own an arsenal of weapons, and the right to sleep with someone else's husband. Oh, and the right to be unbearable after giving up smoking. (For one painted as such a sterling genius, the whole smoking emphasis suffuses the book with an overtone of cognitive dissonance.)The idea is interesting. The sketch of characters is interesting. Patricia Cornwell needs to get out the way and let the story flow."

I'm glad I started with &quot;All That Remains&quot;, and not this book. Come on I know how she feels being involved with a married man, but I don'splitSize wish to be reminded of all the negative possessive, crazy, feelings that take over your mind. I like her acknowledgement in &quot;The Body Farm&quot; that this was not morally right, but that it felt too good to stop. I enjoyed her interactions with people much better in her earlier Dr. Scarpetta works than in this one. While the mystery is still fast paced and has you holding your breath, the interpersonal relations suck. I read to find a relief from having to deal daily with this type of people. Ms. Cornwell has the right idea to get you to identify with Kay, but I had a hard time feeling comfortable identifying with Kay in this book. I've been stressed out, &quot;b***hy&quot;, and &quot;crazied&quot;, over life and men, but I don'splitSize read to be reminded of those unpleasant aspects of life and people. My advise to Ms. Cornwell is to have Dr. Scarpetta to &quot;get a grip&quot;. Deal with life and have fun, don'splitSize get lost in the small things. I also have enjoyed the interplay of Kay's relationship with Benton Wesley much more than with Mark James. I like the idea that Benton is a completion of Kay, a ying to her yang. I wish I knew more men like him who can stand up to a strong-willed, intelligent professional woman and make her a more whole person. I hope Ms. Cornwell will &quot;fix&quot; Kay in her next book, and flesh out a happy relationship between her and Benton (less negative thoughts, more enjoyment and smooth working between the two), and &quot;fix&quot; Lucy too-its ok if she has an alternative lifestyle if you want, but if you don'splitSize want her to be happy in this fashion, find her a boyfriend, not another girlfriend(!!!). I agree with the comments from her next book on Lucy, stop beating a dead horse with Lucy, make her a semi-functional character, or get rid of ! her. In closing, this series on Dr. Scarpetta is a refreshing type of mystery that keeps you on your toes and looking over your shoulder for the killer. I throughly enjoy her style of writing and would recommend her previous books to anyone. However, this book was a grave disappointment, I had come to expect a cool strong-willed, compentent, Dr. Scarpetta, and all I found was a decompensating shell of her former self. If you've read her earlier books you may want to steer away from this one. I found myself greiving for Kay and Ms. Cornwell after finishing this book. Come on lets find the old Kay who has character and stamina to have a great mystery adventure."

Few people have, because it's long and it's dull, something about Rand's philosophy of man against society seen through the eyes of John Gault.Now Ayn Rand ends up in Inspector Penn's bookcase and Temple Gault ends up with a scalpel in his thigh, riding the rails, so to speak.Usually, authors describe villains who we come to dislike. Cornwell's villain, this coke-snorting psychopath, ends up surrounded by all the forces known to man, in New York City anyway. The FBI, the city police, the transit police, you name it. I ended up rooting for the guy to escape, that's how repelled I was by Cornwell's climax, or was it an anti-climax? Was it nothing more than a severed femoral artery?I did learn something from this book: the subways in New York are confusing and homeless people can sleep there. Oh, and I learned that computers have evolved a lot since this book was written.So to sum up, I don'splitSize know which book was more boring, this one or Atlas Shrugged, but neither one is really worth reading, I'd say.

B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,,,3/4,1.0,923961600,Stereotypical characters kill the book,"Cornwell does have somewhat interesting story lines and the ME aspect is definitely interesting. However, any momentum the book hopes to attain is thwarted time and time again by her stereotypical characters. Why does every man have to be a one-dimensional macho idiot who can'splitSize believe that a woman can hold such a serious job? Does Cornwell truly believe that men are like this? Meanwhile, Scarpetta and her niece Lucy are depicted as physically fit, attractive geniuses who eagerly whip up a seven course Italian dinner after working a 16 hour day, everyday. I forgot to mention they are rich and always level-headed with never an 'off' day. Essentially these characters have no challenges left except for contrived (mostly relationship) problems. Scarpetta ponders being perfect while not being loved or able to let herself love another. Well, if she didn'splitSize love herself so much that would be a first step. She's definitely egocentric. Lucy would be as egocentric, but alas, she is humbled through her worship to her shrine - Scarpetta. Lucy was almost challenged with alcoholism but thankfully that challenge ended after a few months (yet another narrow escape from character development). Lucy also has a hard time with relationships and can'splitSize seem to find that right person who complements her intellect and beauty on an even level. To wit, it's lonely at the top. Being perfect is attainable - 1) love yourself first, 2) stay single, 3) proceed with a monastic life of studying all day and night, 4) learn to cook. And remember: what being over-worked, grossly over-sensitive, and self absorbed don'splitSize do for your heart and social life they make up for in your bank account and your bloated sense of self-importance."

And Cornwell does not disappoint--it gets worse and worse and worse, until a conclusion that is as contrived and pointless as any in fiction. Another reviewer on Amazon called this book drivel, but that was perhaps too kind an assessment. This is the lamest book I have ever read.Each character is assigned one trait--Marino is bigoted, Lucy is angry, Benton is beleaguered--with the exception of the star of the show, Kay Scarpetta, who seems to have drawn two traits--stupidity and a major shopping addiction (dropping brand names is her hobby).A brief list of plot sillinesses: can you believe that the FBI would not know the most basic facts about &quot;the nation's most wanted serial killer&quot;--that he has a twin sister and a famous uncle?; can you believe that the FBI would set up an elaborate trap using NYC subways because they could not risk a shootout? (why not just arrest him as he leaves his apartment building, once they have found that?); can you believe that a trained law enforcement person would leave her gun lying around as many times as the dimwit heroine does in this book?Worse than this are the many things that Cornwell throws in that end up having no role in the book--a sick mother in Florida, a subplot abpout her sidekick's love life, her niece's lesbian romances.This book is all filler, no substance.

Sherlock Holmes would be an insufferable boor had his creator not had the sense to tell us of his superiority through the eyes of faithful Dr. Watson. How many times can you use the word &quot;I&quot; in a 412 page book? How about using the third person, Ms. Cornwell? Then we'd know what characters other than Dr. Scarpetta are thinking.Another gripe--too much information. Ms. Cornwell substitutes technical jargon and unneeded facts for solid characterization and plot.

Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant.

B000O3QCH8,From Potter's Field,,,,6/10,1.0,959990400,"400+ pages, with only one good scene","Does anybody really believe that when a joint FBI/police/medical examiner team needs to locate West Coast dental specialists quickly, they would decide the best way is TO SPAM EVERY USER ON PRODIGY asking for a knowledgable dentist to contact them?This book has so many problems, I hardly know where to start. They fall into two main areas -- no, not the print and the page, the pages, at least, are innocent! There are editorial problems, and problems inherent in a story that reads as if it didn'splitSize have the author's full attention.Let's begin with the editorial problems. Do you believe that sirens can &quot;whelp&quot; through the sky? (and is that why we say it's raining cats and dogs? or at least, puppies?)Dialogue moves in and out of a &quot;no contractions&quot; zone, which has the characters suddenly using formal diction -- maybe ONE character in modern America could get away with this, but most of them? How often do senior cops and med. examiners, in casual conversation, say &quot;I will not&quot; and &quot;I do not&quot; instead of &quot;I won'splitSize&quot; or &quot;I don'splitSize&quot;? It's the unevenness that is jolting and extremely irritating, as if there were multiple editors, one of whom didn'splitSize believe in contractions while the others did.But the editors can'splitSize be blamed for the plot problems and general stupidity of the characters. How many times are we expected to believe that people who are told every other sentence that they should not go out alone have yet again gone out alone? One second they're talking about putting Scarpetta into the Federal Witness Protection scheme and the next, she's going into work 2 hours early so she'll have the whole building to yourself -- does anybody think the readers will be surprised when You Know Who intrudes on Scarpetta's early-morning solitude? It happens repeatedly. It's like a B-grade horror movie -- the characters are idiots who walk stupidly into danger they could easily avoid. But then there'd be no book (not necessarily a bad thing).The main character's resemblance to Superman pales quickly. In a crime scene, only Scarpetta will spot the incriminating footprint. In a crowd scene, only Scarpetta will spot the suspect in the crowd. Why bother with all the other police/FBI/NY Transit Police?Even so, Scarpetta doesn'splitSize detect much, she mostly intuits. If more than one person could have done something, you can bet that Scarpetta knows which one did it. How? She just knows. Maybe the rest of the team doesn'splitSize know whether the killer is in Virginia or NY, but Scarpetta does. Why? She just knows. If one character has a high-ranking uncle, and she hears that another is vaguely rumored to be related to someone important, you can bet that she'll guess the two are siblings, and she'll be right, and the reader will not get any more explanation. As a reader, I feel cheated -- where is the detection? If I wanted to read about clairvoyance, I'd be reading books in a different genre.The ONE redeeming feature is the scene in which Scarpetta meets the parents of the serial killer. That jumps off the page. What is it like to have your child turn out to be a monster? How would you react? Cornwell should have developed this, made it the focus of the book, have Scarpetta skillfully tease useful information from the parents, DO SOME DETECTION, instead of having her charging around with an arsenal, hopping planes and FBI 'copters all over the East Coast until you, the reader, feel the jet lag.If Cornwell can write that scene, why did she write 400 pages of drivel to wrap around it? I know that she's a well-known, well-respected author, but she was really asleep at the wheel for this one.I only wish Amazon would let you give a book ZERO stars."

There were 2 things that ruined my enjoyment of this book:1) the main reason was that the plot, and Kay's actions, were totally illogical - someone who is afraid of a murderer stalking her would be more careful than Kay was, for instance... Unlike what I'd expect from a professional dective, Kay Scarfetta doesn'splitSize use logic but follows her intuitions, which don'splitSize seem to be based on anything but her vague feelings that it must be saw, and each and every one of those feelings turn out to be true... That doesn'splitSize make the book very believavle...2) when an author writes a more than one novel wuth the same main character, you could casually pick up of of the books in the middle of the 'series', or even the last book of it, and have a pretty good idea of what's going on, even though you'd have a much broader outlook of things if you read the previous books in the series. But not only does PC use Kay Scarffeta as her main character in numerous books, but she brings Temple Brooks Gault, the villain, back from the past, without giving a thorough background of his and Kay's history, just a little line saying Gault has some things to resent about the detective... And so on... This is just one examples of past characters and occurances that are mentioned in this book that occured or were introduced in the past, and there are so many of them that it really makes the book very vague and gives you a feeling you don'splitSize understand even half of it without having read the previous books.

I read through this book quicker than any of the other Scarpetta novels.It is interesting to see how Kay started off owning just one gun in the first novel, a Ruger .38. And now she has an entire arsenal in her garage.Temple Gault is definatly the most well known of the Scarpetta villans, he is a pure evil killing machine. Although he never actually appears in the book for long periods of time there is always that sence of danger, that he might be around soemwhere, and that he is capable of everything. That is what's so intimidating about him.Overall Scarpetta has created a classic here, itll keep you hooked right up until the climax when Scapetta finally goes head to head with Gault in a deadly battle of wills that will have you on the edge of your seat in excitment.Well doen Miss Cornwell!!!"

Sadly, Cornwell tries to inculcate fear of Gault in the reader's mind, but nothing much seems to happen to Scarpetta anyway, despite her working in what could very well be the least secure government offices in the world!

Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don'splitSize let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel."

The victim is a homeless woman who's body was found propped up next to a fountain. Images of previous murder victims propped up in poses flash though Kay Scarpetta's mind and she knows immediately that this murder seems to be the handy work of Temple Gault. The body count doesn'splitSize end there though as Gault leaves a trail of violence and death. Gault is getting careless and this might mean he will finally slip up enough to be caught. There are a lot of twist and turns in this book that will leave you flipping to just one more page and then another pausing just long enough to get up and make sure that your doors are locked.I have read too many horror novels to count. I've never been scared by any book except for Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. I read right before I go to sleep and there have been nights that I slept with one eye open after reading one of her books. I recommend that you read the series in order to fully understand and enjoy the books.

After reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot;, as well as six other novels by Patricia Cornwell, I must agree with the reviewer's statement. Cornwell has yet to write a book that disappoints me--so far, each book I have read has been more thrilling and stimulating than the last! This book was no exception. In &quot;From Potter's Field&quot;, Kay Scarpetta, Lucy, Marino, and Benton Wesley return to once again match forces with Temple Gault, a notorious serial killer who first surfaced in &quot;Cruel and Unusual&quot;, the fourth book in the Scarpetta series. As usual, Cornwell's elements of obvious research, superb characterization, and plot developement were present, making the story seem very realistic. Everytime something new is introduced into the plot, it all builds up until everything comes together at the end. It was fun to reread parts of the book and figure out how it fit into the picture. Overall, just another great Cornwell book. I don'splitSize know what else I can say about it that has not already been said."

I agree with an earlier reviewer that there were several things that were unrealistic in this one. However, the plot was so good and the action was pretty tense, so I was willing to overlook those details.I was honestly enjoying the book. Then I came to the ending. I had read the Scarpetta series in order from Postmortem to this one. Her serial killer Gault appears in several of the prior books, and the Scarpetta vs. Gualt finale happens here. I won'splitSize give it away, but let me say I was so disappointed that I quit reading the series.The poor ending of this book, combined with the unrealistic events and general lack of research by the author in all her books has made me decide not to read anymore from Cornwell.

Somehow, each day manages to present a situation that is slightly odd, even though sometimes it is a strain to see it that way.McPherson has the perfect mentality and outlook to develop cartoons like this and he does see it that way. They are often exaggerations of the natural foibles of all aspects of life, from elementary school to retirement. There is the teacher that wants all students to contribute, so she ties ropes to their hands so that she can forcibly raise them.

B0007ER3UO,The Starchild Trilogy,,A1BKXSV0FNCQ9A,Rence Reeves,2/2,4.0,1110153600,"The First Two Books Were Really Good, But....","I just finished the last book of the STARCHILD TRILOGY by Pohl and Williamson last week. I thought the first book REEFS OF SPACE was the best.Some of the things I liked about REEFS OF SPACE:The Plan Of Man - A super-computer which runs all human affairs. Citizens must constantly check-in at computer terminals for orders ie. before beginning work, after completing each task, before leaving a room, after entering a room etc.Risks - People who have performed badly, underachieved, or been caught performing unplanned actions or having unplanned thoughts.The Collar - An explosive collar worn by the Risks which can be detonated at anytime The Plan Of Man sees fit. It also explodes automatically if tampered with.The Body Bank - If a Risk continues to screw up or underachieve there is still one way he can contribute to society by providing body parts for transplanting onto or into those citizens who need them in order to remain useful to society.The JunkMan - A man built by using body parts and made to look exactly like one of the donors at The Body Bank in order to take his place so that this donor could escape, the only person ever to do so.There was some cool scientific stuff too; jetless drive, Hoyle theory, simbiotic relationships. But all that mumbo-jumbo means little to me. Just call me Olaf Simpleton because it was the simpler concepts which I found entertaining and interesting.One thing left me cold....At one point in the story someone says that they've known several people who were sent to The Body Bank, but they've never known anyone to recieve a body part from there. Nothing else was ever mentioned about that.=============================Book II=============================The first book of THE STARCHILD TRILOGY (The Reefs Of Space) I gave four stars. This book (STARCHILD) is not quite as good as the first one. I can'splitSize give it 3-1/2 stars so I'll round up and settle with giving it four stars also.In THE REEFS OF SPACE you're shown how The Plan Of Man super-computer affects and controls every aspect of daily life for the citizens of Earth and it's colonies. You also get to experience what it's like to wear The Collar and a really good tour of The Body Bank. In STARCHILD The Collar is still a big part of the story, but only brief mention is made of The Body Bank. This second book of the trilogy also gives an up close and personal view of The Plan Of Man super-computer. You get to see how it needs human extensions of itself, humans who can be completely trusted. You're shown what it takes to become a companion of the computer; the education and training involved, the surgical modifications needed, and the sacrafice of ""self"" and the leaving behind of all that had been a part of your previous life, including loved ones. You also get to see what it's like to live out on the reefs as free men, out of the reach of The Plan Of Man. The climactic ending is great.If you intend reading the entire trilogy I suggest you stop after this book, I could hardly finish ROGUE STAR(the third book). You DO need to read the first book(The Reefs Of Space), but I'd say the conclusion of STARCHILD is adequate enough to wrap up the series.=============================BOOK III============================This trilogy got progressively worse for me. The first book (REEFS OF SPACE) I really liked and it was my favorite, but by the time I reached the final pages of the third book (ROGUE STAR) I didn'splitSize really know where the authors were heading with it and I really didn'splitSize care.I felt they had abandoned some earlier concepts a little too early, and perhaps could have pursued and developed other story-lines further. I hate when that happens! Abandoning one really cool concept or story-line for a lame one. I couldn'splitSize buy into that ""infant star has a crush on a beautiful woman"" thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It ate her boyfriend and that's why it has feelings for her. Still not sold."

Stevens,2/6,1.0,1136073600,I hope no one takes this book seriously,"A synopsis of the first chapter: around 12,000 BCE, three very powerful civilizations existed in and around the Mediterranean. Atlantis was a mini-continent in the Atlantic Ocean west of the Straight of Gibraltar. The Osirian Empire was located in the basin of what is now the Mediterranean Sea and the Rama Empire existed throughout Persia and into India. The civilizations of both Atlantis and Rama possessed flying airships, very similar to those commonly reported as modern-day UFOs. In addition, the Rama Empire had some type of laser-based weapon. They used anti-gravity technology to levitate giant cut stones weighing three million pounds into position at a site in modern-day Lebanon as a landing pad for their airships.According to Jared Diamond, a preeminent cultural anthropologist, the development of agriculture did not occur until around 11,000 BCE and was localized in the Fertile Crescent until 7,500 BCE. Since one can trace food surpluses as a requirement for the settlement of cities and subsequent development of technology in cultures all over the world, it seems unlikely, at best, that the Rama Empire possessed airships, laser weapons and anti-gravity technology before humans domesticated the pea (in 8,500 BCE). It just seems a little difficult to believe that in between hunting and gathering, people had time to construct flying ships, weaponize lasers and employ anti-gravity technology. This is especially remarkable given that it took humans 14,000 years to redevelop the technology for flight and we still haven'splitSize been able to weaponize lasers or develop anti-gravity technology.The book may appeal to people looking for an interesting read, but it should not be taken as a scholarly work. In fact, the author's attempts to cite scholarly sources and research to justify his claims are laughable. Also, there are numerous typographical errors (mostly omitted prepositions and possessives as well as punctuation errors)."

He thoroughly covers all of the major and most of the minor historical sites to be found throughout Africa and Arabia, often at great personal risk. It took guts to make the journeys he has made, many of which were in areas very dangerous for Americans, and a talent for writing to make them interesting.

Whether one swallows DHC's views on Atlantis or the 'Osirian Empire' is really beside the point, as this book's value lies primarily in its entertaining and evocative travelogue, not in any pretensions to accuracy. Even if DHC's theories are completely bogus, his books still make entertaining reading.The reviewers who dismiss DHC's books as worthless because he isn'splitSize a scientist and engages in speculation (sample sentence: ""1932 was a good year for mysterious ancient roads in Kenya"") are themselves remarkably clown-like in their earnest simplicity. The book provides an argument against them in the form of a great quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: ""for God's sake give me a young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself!""Previous African travelogues I read include Shiva Naipaul's 'North of South' and Paul Theroux's 'Dark Star Safari', both of them sardonic, near-misanthropic works. While DHC doesn'splitSize have a literary style to match those accomplished authors, his wide-eyed optimism and childlike sense of adventure at least make an interesting contrast to the jaded cynicism of Naipaul and Theroux.As one would expect from someone who has hitchhiked through the Middle East and Africa, DHC is full of entertaining travel tales and encounters with amusing characters, like the Palestinian truck driver he gets a lift with in Jordan who makes an unexpected stop at a tent in the desert, which turns out to be a brothel, then emerges minutes later zipping his pants up, saying ""no good, no good...""In Israel he is taken to hospital with gangrene, and just as he is about to be treated, finds the place is suddenly deserted. The doctors have all gone home for the sabbath, and he has to wait another two days for treatment...One part of the book that intrigued me dealt with the mysterious Tuaregs of the Ahaggar mountains in southern Algeria. Their chief town is called Tamanrasset (i.e. Taman-Ra-Set)...a survival of ancient Egyptian paganism in a remote pocket of the Islamic world? The Arabs are said to be afraid of these mountains, and many eerie and surrealistic tales are told of them.DHC's book will appeal to those who like hitchhiking travel stories, or those who like esoteric speculation (or both). I doubt it will appeal to puritanical empiricists, but there are plenty of other books they can read instead."

Some people seem to get hung up on this, so let's make that real clear. I always see his books in the &quot;Travel Narrative&quot; section of the bookstore, and that's exactly what they are... great travel narratives.The books has two modes. Mr. Childress' travel stories, and his telling of &quot;wacky&quot; theories of the places he visits. Within the first 25 pages, you have stories of ancient nuclear weapons, flying machines, and continent spanning civilizations that no one has heard of! And he explains that this is the &quot;easiest&quot; way of rationalizing the things he has seen! (Such as, giant blocks of stone that are too big to move, &quot;even by modern engineering&quot;).On the whole, this is a great read if you want some insight into the crazy ideas that exist out there.

Then again, &quot;Godzilla vs. Monster Zero&quot; wasn'splitSize a very &quot;good&quot; (if we must assign labels) movie. Childress, a &quot;maverick archaeologist&quot; who seems to spend most of his time floundering around grimly impoverished Third World locales and getting nowhere with evasive women at bars, provides an insanely amusing travelogue of his journeys through the jungles and exotic landscapes of Africa and Arabia, commenting along the way on the unknown Atlantean, Lemurian, and other civilizations that flourished once upon a time and were responsible for the Pyramids, THE MAHABHARATA, and presumably Jimmy Hoffa's and D.B. Cooper's whereabouts. The most insane thing about this book is that a lot of it might be true. So far as I know, we still know very little about the Neolithic era, and the concept of &quot;lost&quot; civilizations would imaginably appeal to many readers depressed at the state of the world (including myself). However, I must agree with the other negative reviewer that Childress offers no convincing evidence to support his theories (and not very much UNconvincing evidence, either). The only sources he uses are hopelessly mossbound Victorian &quot;explorers&quot; (who knows how many African bearers' lives they may have used up to supply this book with fodder for speculation?) who had their own &quot;issues&quot; to deal with.

He paints Lincoln's portrait onto the background of the sectional conflict that led to the Civil War. Originally published about 1961, Donald's stories remain fresh and relevant. In fact the reader will encounter the thesis and outline for his recent prize-winning biography of Lincoln. I first encoutered LR in 1962 when I taught Advanced Placement American History and assigned portions of the book to my students. They loved it; you will. Donald is a superlative historian and stylist. Listen to these chapter headings: Getting Right With Lincoln, Reconsideration of Abolitionists, Herndon and Mrs. Lincoln, Folklore Lincoln, An Excess of Democracy. Readers of Donald's Lincoln will want to have this as a companion reference piece. It's rare for an historian's essays to experience such a rich and extended publishing history. Here's a quote from my faded copy of LR, a touch of wisdom for our parlous times: &quot;...Lincoln knew that there were limits rational human activity, and that there was no virtue in irritably seeking to perform the impossible. As President, he could only do his best to handle problems as they arose and have a patient trusdt that popular support for his solutions would be forthcoming. But the ultimate decision was beyond his, or any man's, control. 'Now at the end of three years struggle,' he said, 'the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.'&quot; Page after page runs like this, and virtually every theme connected to the Civil War gets enough discussion to stimulate and edify."

First published in 1956 and now in its third edition, the essays have worn well, providing great insight into Lincoln the man as opposed to Lincoln the myth, much in the vein of Richard N. Current's The Lincoln Nobody Knows. Had Donald accomplished nothing else this would be a valuable addition to everyone's Lincoln reference library. But the value of Donald's insights goes beyond those of Lincoln and his era. As a former Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics teacher, there is much in this slim volume that is instructive for our contemporary divided America, essays relevant and useful in today's classrooms. And insights which serve as a warning, particularly his comment that, ""At only one time have rigid ideologists dominated our national government--the Sumners of the North, the Jefferson Davises of the South--and the result was near disaster."" (p. 13) Let us pray in 2013 that history does not repeat itself. In more or less chronological order Donald examines: Getting Right With Lincoln, The Folklore Lincoln, Toward a Reconsideration of Abolitionists, An Excess of Democracy: The American Civil War and the Social Process, Education Defective: Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness, Herndon and Mary Lincoln, Refighting the Civil War, The Radicals and Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and the American Pragmatic Tradition, A Whig in the White House, Reverence for the Laws: Abraham Lincoln and the Founding Fathers, and A. Lincoln, Politician. In each essay Donald challenges conventional wisdom and asks the reader to reconsider what he or she may have thought to be established fact. He also frequently confronts historiography that he considers to be biased, narrow minded, or serving an agenda. It's okay to ""get right"" with Lincoln in the sense of looking to Lincoln for guidance in challenging times; it's not okay to do so by removing him from the proper context of his times or to pretend that he could do no wrong. Those readers who own a copy of any of Donald's other books will certainly want this as a companion volume."

While awkward, that title was certainly perceptive. This book takes research that perhaps never found a place in other papers or books about Lincoln and uses it to show us a different way to see him and the events leading to the Civil War.This book contains numerous interesting bits of information about Lincoln although the one piece I found most interesting was the fact that Lincoln was a land surveyor for a time. Many writers focus on Lincoln's limited education but a surveyor must have a good understanding of mathematics and by most accounts, Lincoln was very competent. This brings to issue the long standing belief that Lincoln had little formal education but,according to the author, Lincoln's formal education was consistant with that received by young people at that time.There are some sections of this book where Lincoln's name fails to appear and the reader might have cause to wonder if he is reading the wrong book. Fortunately, these little detours are not only interesting but help us see Lincoln and the Civil War period from a new perspective.I found this short book (about 200 pages) to be interesting and engaging. It was written by an author who understands how to communicate and keep the reader's interest. I would recommend it to anyone having an interest in Lincoln or the Civil War."

The collection, periodically updated and reprinted, hold up pretty well as an antidote to Lincoln the myth, offering instead Lincoln the man of flesh and blood.Many of the myths with which Donald does battle are still prevalent, and his thoughtful essays provide insight and context on a remarkable man, raised on the American frontier and largely self-made, who became a successful lawyer, politician, and wartime president. Donald discusses Lincoln's background, education, his Whig politican background, and the adroit way in which he managed his administration during the Civil War. Among the touchy issues are Lincoln's handling of the Emancipation Proclomation and his selective curbing of civil war during the rebellion. Donald acknowledges many contradictions, but offers some pathways to understanding a complex man whose life has been distorted by both historians and more recent politicians; highly recommended to students of Lincoln and of the Civil War."

This takes a bit of time and expands on it very nicely. It starts out with a nice introdution about Lincoln and his times, the people he knew and worked with, then goes onto the politics and war. It had some anecdotes that you never see anywhere else. It turns out that Linoln was not a rabid emancipationist, but a pratical president who did things as needed to be done. I wondered before why he only freed the slaves in the states in rebellion: it was because he did not want to alienate the slaveholders in Kentucky and Maryland. I am still mystified as to the reason for the war of northern aggression: slavery does not seem to be the all inclusive answer that mythology makes it out to be, and this book shows some altenative reasons, but does not take a stand, after it is only a collection of essays."

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2X016MRJ0XVT6,David J. Heinrich,9/16,5.0,1072224000,The criticisms of this book are flawed,"Rather than explaining why this is a good book (other revierw's do that), I'll explain why some of the idiotic criticisms levied against this book are wrong.The most silly criticism of Hazlitt (and other Austrian free-market economists) is that they aren'splitSize &quot;scientific&quot; and in short &quot;don'splitSize use enough math&quot;. This is an absurd criticism. Firstly, human beings are not deterministic particles who's behaviour can be predicted by simple equations. Any attempt to reduce human behaviour to some mathematical equation is pure non-sense. We must consider human beings as individual entities who can choose, not fixed constants in mathematical formuli.Secondly, there is a mathematics that is relevant to Austrians. It is chaos theory and network theory. Chaos theory is currently used to predict the weather. The calculus used by Keynes and other idiots like him is completely useless for describing the behaviour of chaotic systems where individual choice is involved. Hazlitt may not mention Chaos Theory. For that, see Murray N. Rothbard, &quot;Choas Theory: Destroying Mathematics from Within?&quot;; and Gene Callahan, &quot;Why Austrians Should Care About Network Science&quot;. Anyone with any sympathy for Keynes and his idiotic followers should note that Keynes put forth a &quot;treatise&quot; before General Theory, which was demolished by Hayek. Hayek then made a strategical mistake in not demolishing General Theory, feeling that the book's idiocy stood for itself. Also note that while Hayek recieved a Nobel Prize for work which was basically an extension of Mises business cycle theory (Mises died the year before Hayek's Nobel), Keynes received no Nobel, showing that even the dimwits awarding that title realized Keynes work was inherently worthless.The next criticism is related to the first: that Hazlitt doesn'splitSize discuss game theory. The reason for this is that game theory is particularly unworthy of discussion. Nash, founder of Game Theory, showed that in any finite game, there's an equilibrium in which no player can improve his or her outcome given the other player's strategies (the Nash Equilibrium). This is problematic in several ways. Firstly, there is absolutely no relation between the playing of games (which are less than net-zero, with one winner and one or more losers) and economics. Secondly, only Game Therorists behave in real situations in the ways in which Game Theory predicts. Thirdly, strategies are not data, but choices. Fourth, it is possible to break out of the specified game to achieve a superior result.One particularly ignorant reviewer says that in a completely unhampered free market, monopolies form, destroying competition. This is non-sense. Empirically, Ancient Ireland was a completely Stateless society for a thousand years, with a completely unhampered free market, and no-such thing occured. And of course it is a bunch of non-sense that can'splitSize happen in reality anyeways. A monopoly is only harmful if you have monopoly prices. But in a completely free market, even if someone obtains 100% of all (say) rail-roads, there is still competition between that form of transportation and other forms, thus monopoly prices cannot be charged. The only time real monopolies with monopoly pricing have emerged is because of State interference.This may not be the best book on economics that you can read (look to Mises' &quot;Human Action&quot; for what is most likely the strongest treatise on &quot;economics&quot; [actually praxeology, a much larger field]) ever written."

The result is a remarkably pragmatic and groundbreaking treatise in economic theory that anyone will find understandable and compelling.Strangely enough, when I was getting my B.A. in Economics from an institution of higher learning called Rockford College (Class of '74), I was never introduced to the works of Henry Hazlitt; it's too bad, getting that degree would've been so much easier.Now, thirty-five years later, stumbling upon Amazon's recommendations for me, I finally grabbed this book; better late than never.The past year or so, thanks in large part to the worst financial crisis since The Great Depression, the subject of economic theory has been hot. People want to know what went wrong. As Guy Sorman concludes in his marvelous book,Economics Does Not Lie: A Defense of the Free Market in a Time of Crisis, what went wrong is the ill-advised government intervention---not just in America, but globally. Governments rarely get it right when they try to intervene; their short-term fixes usually have long-term negative ramifications.The free market economy is what lured Russia into ending the Cold War twenty years ago. It helped 800 million Chinese greatly improve their economic well-being, as well.

The ""one lesson"" is broad enough that it covers pretty much any topic in economics, so the author is free to discuss a long list of subjects and applications.Despite being written decades ago, this book is (unfortunately) very timely. The blowout government spending of the last few years shows clearly that our society has forgotten much, perhaps most, of how economics works.The only drawback to the book is that its title implies it covers all of economics. I had expected a one-book summary of the entire science (micro to macro).Instead, the book's primary focus is on how government actions affect the economy. Granted, our government today interferes in almost every sector of the economy, so this makes the book more broadly relevant than the author probably would have liked.Still, the basics of micro economics are not really covered here.

The ideas are still pertinent, but many examples are not as relevant today.2) I'm afraid that reading Naked Economics first spoiled me a bit. This book lacked the humor and pep that kept me engrossed in the former.3) Most importantly, the book is strictly about economics, and is too simplistic in some ways. It fails to incorporate the complex real world political dynamics that determine policy. Today, most congressmen are sold on the benefits of free trade. But the barriers to economic growth are more nuanced in the real world.Some will argue that this was not the focus of the book, and they are correct. Still, I fear that a reader will latch onto Hazlitt's ideas as a panacea, and fail to appreciate that in a world where ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" is as important, if not more important, than how much wealth one has, that policy decisions are more complex that the author would have us believe."

Hazlitt makes a cogent argument that overall productivity in macro-markets is maximized by classical economic policies with an emphasis on unregulated markets. But on let us not get too easily carried away by this author's reduction.The global markets of our age are, after all, dominated by the great (and institutionally amoral) transnational corporations we've been effectively forced to know so well. Despite spectacular public relations, these have in many important way proved themselves untrustworthy as guardians and promoters of our collective interests.Robert Kuttner's ""Everything For Sale,"" to give one example, provides excellent and badly needed counterbalance to Hazlitt's argument. Kuttner gives numerous examples of issues that most of us would consider very important (such as health and the environment) and goes into probing and very revealing detail on why and how so-called free markets simply fail."

It is well written, succinct and, in places, an accurate exegesis of free market economics. In much of the text, Hazlitt artfully debunks incorrect reasoning that often drives economic policy. Insofar as the book limits itself to that modest goal, it succeeds admirably. But when Hazlett more ambitiously attempts to purvey free market economics as singular truth the book falls painfully short.Hazlitt, like other free market economists, forgets that free market theory is only a pardigm. Free market thinking is useful to the extent that the conditions precedent to a free market are fulfilled; but no further. When the assumptions underlying free market thought are not met, the theory may fail. And in virtually ignoring this fact the book founders.For example, Hazlitt never mentions the problem of externalities which free markets inevitably fail to address. And his actors always conform to behavior convenient for free market theory. To paraphrase Garrison Keillor, Hazlett's universe is a paradise where all the markets are strong, all the investments are attractive and all the profits are above average.But there are other failings, too. The dislocations of a free market economy are generally trivialized. Unemployment is almost viewed as a benefit to workers when resultant from free market operations; as if a pink slip were a toll pass for the Yellow Brick Road leading to the Oz of more efficient employment. In several places Hazlitt is inconsistent, as when discussing the failure of marginal producers (a benefit when caused by free market processes in declining industries; an evil when caused by ""excessive"" wage demands by labor). Remarkably, he adverts to the ""inappropriate"" political power wielded by labor and farmers due to their disproportionate numbers, while never mentioning the truly undue influence that corporate largesse has on governing institutions. What Hazlett considers improper political influence most of us would consider functioning democracy.In summary, this book is a useful and brief introduction to free market economics. So long as one recognizes its limitations, well . . .no harm, no foul. But for true economic enlightenment you will have to look elsewhere."

He uses a story form to educate the readers on the problems with typically inflicted governmental action in about 25 areas including the following: government 'make work' projects, taxes, credit, machinery, reductions in numbers of government employees, tariffs, price fixing, subsidizing commodities, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, profits, and attacks on savings.As politicians around the world, including the United States, regularly make harmful errors in their attempts to buy votes, this should be required reading for all of them, as well as college economics professors who are so enamoured with Keynes and Marx.Hazlitt does a great job in making the case that, prior to taking action on economic issues, decision makers should look at the effect on everyone involved (not just the groups that they are trying to seduce into voting for them) as well as the long range implications of the policy.Readers should come away from reading this with a clear understanding of the marvels of a free market (if we were ever allowed to have one) and the incredibly damaging effects of governmental manipulations of the economy. I would strongly recommend this for reading by all voters who want to be knowlegeable as well as all elected and appointed officials."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A13A4X4NIL6HOK,Greg Drew,8/11,5.0,1269734400,Hazlitt challenges government interventions on every level.,"Have you ever wondered whether society needs welfare, rent control, minimum wage, or really any other of these types of safety nets to get along? I read this book a while ago, but I can say It changed the very way I thought about politics, philosophy, and economics. I found myself reading paragraphs over and over again to understand all the implications of his wordy logic. I really don'splitSize see how people can say this book is outdated considering our economy is faltering as a result of programs Henry Hazlitt considers unnecessary and even immoral. The unintended consequences of social programs now glare at me everywhere I turn.Let's take minimum wage. If you grabbed some random guy off the street and asked whether there should be a minimum wage he would probably say yes- and if you're where I live he would say the current $7.25 ""isn'splitSize enough."" Well first of all, who gets to decide what a ""living wage"" is anyway? Isn'splitSize a question like that totally subjective, in the eye of the beholder one might say? If everyone were able to force their employer to pay what they consider ""just"" ($50/hour for stocking groceries sounds nice,) every business would fail rather swiftly. I usually hear that all businessmen are evil and they will always seek to ""exploit"" the labor force by paying an ""unfair wage."" I think if this were the case everyone would be making minimum wage. Businesses have to compete to attract employees and offering higher wages is the way to accomplish that. So why implement a minimum wage in the first place? I'm sure it is seen as a solution to help the poor, obviously if businessmen were forced to give more money for labor those working would be better off right?First lets see what happens to the business. The cost of production has been raised and I feel inclined to say that business will raise prices though this usually wouldn'splitSize be the case. Most prices are already at a point where if you lower them the firm wouldn'splitSize be making a profit and if you raise prices demand will fall to a point where you also wouldn'splitSize be making a profit. The only other solution is to lower cost of production. This will lead to the unemployment of those whose productivity doesn'splitSize justify such a high wage. In the case of where I work no one was immediately laid off but as people quit here and there others were not hired in their stead. Basically if you working a low-skilled job and the government arbitrarily forces your employer to pay you more, you could very well be out of a job all-together. So actually yes, those who are left working would be better off but it will be at the expense of those who have lost their jobs. Which is better $2/hr. or $0/hr? Minimum wage creates unemployment which hurts the poorest the worst.Or heres a simple one, economic stimulus. Can government stimulate growth in an economy? What if government spends billions of dollars on projects they deem appropriate? I think on the face of it economic stimulus makes no sense simply because all funds going into the economy necessarily had to come from the economy. Even when you print money for these purposes you will eventually have to pay for them in the form of inflation. Not to mention whatever the government decides as an appropriate project will have to be contrary to what consumers actually want considering the force required to carry out these plans.I highly recommend this book, even if you are a layman don'splitSize be discouraged by the word ""economics."" I would consider myself very simple and I feel I grasped this whole capitalism concept pretty well. I can'splitSize stress enough the importance of the private ownership over the means of production, the market forces businesses to serve our needs, government will only join up with the wealthy and double-team our poor little behinds.

This has probably never been truer today. People who can explain how economics work in a simple way are rare. Henry Hazlitt is one of few. This book was first written in 1946, a time when his views were unfashionable (John Maynard Keynes was the role model at this time), and it was slightly updated in 1979 when his opinions were back in vogue. Hazlitt is a hero in libertarian circles, both in the past with friends like Ayn Rand, Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, and right now with praise from Ron Paul and Steve Forbes. However, I don'splitSize think you have to be a libertarian or a conservative to appreciate this book. Over 1 million copies have been sold so far.The book's subtitle is ""The Shortest And Surest Way To Understand Basic Economics"" which probably is true, especially if you politically have more conservative views. The book opens strongly with part one ""The Lesson"", which on eight pages explains the basics, which actually is enough to read. Then that is applied on various topics like why there is no net benefit to the economy from broken windows or wars, plus several chapters on why less government is better than more.This must be one of the easiest books to read in the field of economics. Very simple language and complex issues are dealt with head on. They are beautifully explained. The text is a pleasure to read, and an entertaining read too, since you tend to side with the author against everyone else, who doesn'splitSize seem to understand anything.The battle among economists (say the Austrian school against the Keynesian), politicians (Tea Party against Obama) or countries (like Germany against PIIGS) is as fierce as it has ever been. It's been an on-going battle since the gold standard fell out of favour during the 1930's. The topics of the current debate in Europe, Japan and the US are the same. More or less government intervention, more or less/no QE etc. My favourite chapter is part three, which was added in 1979, which has the title ""The Lesson After Thirty Years"". His conclusion then was that politicians had learnt nothing. The policies he had warned for in 1946 had been implemented by politicians and the western world was now suffering because of that. He focused specifically on the topic of the decade, inflation. He viewed it as an effect of a big increase in government spending, big government deficits and the big increase in stock of money.His discussion around this problem feels very current. Despite that everything had gone against him over those 30 years, and that he concludes that the outlook is dark he manages to find some hope. That hope was that he felt that the ""Keynesians"" and the ""New Dealers"" were in retreat, and that the conservatives, libertarians and the defenders of free enterprise were more outspoken. That hope actually proved to be right, in the sense that inflation was killed. However, I highly doubt that he in his wildest dreams would have guessed what actually happened over the following decades and that he would have been very unhappy with the current situation. Still, just as in 1979, I guess he would have seen some hope in the debate.In part one he has even narrowed down his lesson, to one sentence ""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists of tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups"".Mr Hazlitt died in 1993 (98 years old). If not, I would have looked forward to an update, a chapter four - The Lesson after 64 years.This is a review by eqtbooks.com"

I say this only to indicate that I have some degree of knowledge of the subject matter at hand. Despite studying close to 3 years of economics, Henry Hazlitt's magnificent work, Economics in One Lesson, is still a valuable resource. Even Keynesian economists will find something of value in this legendary introduction to Austrian economics. Whether you are a layman or a college educated economist, I'm sure this classic work will be of some worth to you.Positive Aspects:1) Hazlitt is an excellent writer. I can not imagine an economics book that is more clearly and concisely written.2) Hazlitt is, for the most part, absolutely correct. Despite what you hear in modern media, government intervention is, in general, harmful to the economy as a whole.3) The chapters are short. Anyone can sit down for a few minutes, read a chapter or two, and gain some knowledge relevant to economic discourse.4) Compared with other works on economics, this book is something of a page-turner. You won'splitSize be bored to death trying to deal with complicated mathematics of graphs.5) A wide variety of topics concerning government intervention in the economy are covered. Amazingly, nearly the entire book is relevant to modern discussions.Negative Aspects:1) Some of the arguments in Hazlitt's work are simply too brief. His reasoning doesn'splitSize always feel fully fleshed out, nor is he always charitable to the opposing viewpoint.In conclusion, I feel Hazlitt's book is somewhat impossible to summarize. I will attempt to do my best. Anyone who is even somewhat interested in economics will benefit from reading this book, whether or not they agree with the author's conclusions. It is a classic economics introduction for a reason, after all. I would recommend this work to anyone who has even a passing interest in economics.

It has really interesting examples, like what's the economic benefit or detriment to an economy, if a thug tosses a brick through a shopkeeper's store window? The broken window will create jobs for the people who make new glass windows, but what does this do to the economy as a whole? Even though the book centers on this example, and examples really similar to this, it covers tons of different topics in economics.Everyone should read this book!

His method is to show an example of bad economic policy, explain how it adversely affects the market, and then teach good policy using logical reasoning. Along those lines, the book does not address basics such as supply and demand, but rather tackles questions like, ""What is the effect of government credit on production?"" Nonetheless, an absolute beginner should be able to understand the concepts presented here, even though the finer points may be lost. After reading this work, you will be able to analyze and evaluate economic policy and reason about its effects on the market.Pay no heed to those that accuse Hazlitt of taking a narrow-minded, Libertarian viewpoint.

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2AKT5NNBA4MOU,"Robert W. Weeks ""Bob""",6/7,5.0,1213056000,"If you read only one economics book, read this","This book, first published in 1946, explains common fallacies (a false or mistaken idea) that are particularly common in the field of economics and public policy. At the very start of the book Mr. Hazlitt explains:Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine -- the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for then plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.At first it seems as though not much has changed since the end of World War II. What has changed, though, is the scope of the dangers Mr. Hazlitt identifies. That's because government is much expanded and more assertive today than when this book was written. In 1946 the New Deal was not very old, and the tremendous expansion of government social programs was still in the future. We should take these lessons as even more important today.It is the overlooked consequences that cause harm. They are overlooked sometimes because they are difficult to see, as in the broken window fallacy explained by Frederic Bastiat and also in this book. They are also ""overlooked"" because, as Mr. Hazlitt tells us, one group wants special favors from the government, and although there is no way to grant these favors without harming some other group, the favor-seeking group will seek to hide, obfuscate, muddle, or minimize the bad effects. At the same time they promote the policy as good for everyone. This is largely the job that lobbyists perform, and billions are spent on it each year. That's because a powerful government has the ability to bestow valuable favors, those favors being paid for by someone else, someone often not easily seen.An example of overlooked secondary consequences is government spending. When government spends, it means it must tax or borrow. What government spends is not available for individuals to spend. When we see magnificent public works (say a new downtown arena in Wichita), we don'splitSize see all the things that would have been bought had the government not taxed to build the public work. We see the jobs created by the public work -- all the construction workers that will be building the new arena -- but we don'splitSize see the jobs destroyed because people had to reduce their spending elsewhere.Foreign trade is a case where people often fail to grasp the complete picture. We often see exports as something good for our economy, while imports are seen as bad. Imported things are things that American workers can'splitSize compete with, and so American jobs are lost, it is often said. But as Mr. Hazlitt says: ""It is exports that pay for imports. The greater exports we have, the greater imports we must have, if we ever expect to get paid. The smaller imports we have, the smaller exports we can have. Without imports we can have no exports, for foreigners will have to funds with which to buy our goods."" So those wanting restrictions on imports are also -- although they do not say this, either because they do not recognize it or it doesn'splitSize matter to them -- calling for fewer exports.In recent years we have been told that our is a ""consumer-driven"" economy, fueled by people tapping their home equity that accumulated from increased home values, or spending by going into debt. It is as though if consumers started saving rather then spending on immediate consumption, the American economy would collapse. But Mr. Hazlitt tells us that ""saving is only another form of spending."" After all, what is done with money that is saved? Today, few put their savings under the mattress. Instead, it is loaned to a bank or invested. Then it is spent on capital goods, which businesses use to increase their productive capability. The key fact is that businesses spend it. And, they spend it on capital goods that either expand their capacity to produce, or decease their present costs of production. Either way, that is good for everyone. It means more jobs, and better jobs. But this saving is derided as not being ""productive.""As a conclusion Mr. Hazlitt tells us:And this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than producer, are considered.To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.This is a very valuable book, which while dated a bit, cuts through the fog and haze of economics and public policy and lets us understand the effects of our government's policies."

This is a very terrible thing. Because knowledge of economics is so crucially important to our understanding of human behavior and the world, I think it *should* be accessible to more people. For this reason, I am always on the lookout for books that help people understand economics easily. That way, we can have a much better world.I have found few books better for the beginner than _Economics in One Lesson_. Henry Hazlitt's book here is very highly regarded and for good reason: it's an excellent, simple look at economic issues that teaches an important lesson. That lesson? That good economics entails looking at the long-term effects of economic policies on *everyone*, rather than the short-term effects on one group. With this, we can see that when the government intervenes in the economy, there are always consequences that not immediately evident.Although the book was originally published in 1946, the topics covered by Hazlitt are pertinent and explore issues that still confront us more than 50 years later. Topics include inflation, tariffs, taxation, price fixing, labor unions, savings, the importance of profits, rent control, and more. Hazlitt writes well and doesn'splitSize obfuscate the truths of matters with cumbersome graphs and math.Please ignore James McDuffie's fatuous review. Most of the ""implicit assumptions"" Hazlitt makes are unassailable facts of reality established a priori. (Except for the assumption that government can be the *only* provider of some services, like roads, ""health officers,"" police, etc.) Also, mathematics is all but useless in economics. The Keynesian paradigm no longer deserves any serious attention since it has been so thoroughly refuted a hundred thousand times over. Inflation as being beneficial to the economy is a fallacy that is easily destroyed by someone with a basic knowledge of money & credit theory. Alan Greenspan a free market proponent? That's ridiculous -- he definitely was 40 years ago but he has since become anathema to the economic prosperity. In fact he's probably the most destructive Federal Reserve Chairman in history.Pick up this book and Gene Callahan's _Economics for Real People_ and you'll probably have a better economic education than you will find with any undergraduate degree in neoclassical economics. I'm serious."

He doesn'splitSize advocate the elimination of all levels of government in the economy, only those that are undeniably counter- productive and even destructive. He definitely would not get along very well with Keynesian economists.I like the examples that Hazlitt uses in this book, because they make it very easy to understand exactly what he is talking about. This is very helpful to readers who may not have much understanding of economics.Hazlitt avoids talking about statistics and he doesn'splitSize utilize graphic illustrations. I think some graphs would have been helpful, because it makes the points easy to visualize. But I think the reason that Hazlitt avoids graphs and statistics is because he wanted this book to be timeless. True, the book has undergone several revisions over the years, but the basic information and the debunking of economic myths that held true 50 years ago still hold true today.Another thing that makes this book and easy one to read is the way Hazlitt divides the book into so many short chapters. The total length of this book is only 214 pages, yet it includes 26 chapters. That makes each chapter only about 8 pages in length, on average. Some are very short, like chapter 2 (the one on the broken window) which is only 2 pages in length. Keep in mind that Hazlitt didn'splitSize intend this book to be an argumentative analysis on the pros and cons of government intervention. He only meant to show the reader exactly what happens, when government sticks its ugly head into areas where it doesn'splitSize belong, and how these actions are detrimental to the overall economy over time. They might seem helpful in the short run, but they are destructive in the long run.If there is one lesson that Hazlitt tries to drive home in this book, it's the tendency of people to be short- sighted when they evaluate the ramifications of government involvement in the economy; and the almost universal tendency to only see one side of the issue. For example, with tariffs, we are all fooled by politicians into supporting them because we think about the jobs that will be saved. We don'splitSize even think about the higher prices that will result from the tariff, which must be borne by the people who purchase the product. We don'splitSize think about the jobs that will be lost by other industries that would have received our extra money, had we not been forced to pay the higher price that the tariff resulted in. We see the trees, but not the forest.Overall, this is a good book to read by anyone who would like to see these common economic myths proven wrong. Don'splitSize be misled by the book's title. This is not a basic economic theory book. It's a book about the negative effects of government intervention in the economy, and it does an effective job in exposing these myths."

This makes it possible for even freshmen with notoriously short attention spans to read the day's chapter.Hazlitt's &quot;one lesson&quot; is simple, and told in Chapter 1. The rest of the chapters are all stories in which the lesson plays a prominent role.

Hazlitt's book is remarkably readable, coherent, and logical. It just confirms that truth is usually understandable, whereas complicated obfuscation is usually the major alarm bell that tips you off when people are trying to shaft you. This guy really knows his stuff.The one lesson is so simple that it takes about five minutes to read the chapter about it. The rest of the book lists various scenarios in which that lesson applies. The general principle of the lesson applies so naturally to various specific cases that it simplifies economics immensely. Hazlitt must have studied logic as well as economics.The one lesson is simply this: economic planning should take into account the effects of economic policies on all groups, not just some groups, and what those effects will be in the long run, not just the short run. That's it. That's the lesson. Fallacious economic policies almost invariably seek to benefit one group at the expense of all others, or to bring about short-term benefits at the expense of long-term benefits. With this as his thesis, Hazlitt examines the numerous manifestations of such fallacies in different situations.His chapters are short, his prose is easy to follow, and his logic is compelling. I've never taken an economics class in my life, yet I had no trouble following the reasoning in this book. This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand basic economics and the keys to widespread prosperity in the long run."

He surmises that during that period, nothing was learned. If anything, he says, subjects related in the book (wage rates, price controls, government ""make work"") have become more political. I wonder what Hazlitt would say now.You need to read this book in order to appreciate the real consequences of actions your government wants to take. The theme emphasized over and over in the book is that actions must be thought through to see what the long term effects will be, not just the highly visible short term ones."

Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he comes over as extremely objective because he doesn'splitSize need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against--kickbacks for hardworking but suffering farmers, for example-- are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won'splitSize offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you."

Hazlitt's parable of the broken window, meant to show how what dosen'splitSize happen as a result of human action is at least as important as what does, is the best introduction to economic theory for the average reader since Adam Smith. The visible results that people see as a result of government intervention in the market must be weighed against what did not come to pass because of the reallocation of resources (i.e., your hard-earned money) that such action necesitates. This book is timeless, in that it is not tied to concrete examples drawn from the headlines of 1946, and is also remarkably free of venom , passion, or spite, which too often mar polemical works on economics - and serve to camouflage bad reasoning. This book can be a basic education in itself, or the beginning of deeper study, in the works of Von Mises, Von Hayek, Schumpeter, or of Hazlett himself.

Macleod ""pnmacleod""",26/31,4.0,1053129600,"Great Book, but Where is the MISSING CHAPTER?","This is an excellent book that is easy to follow and understand. The one lesson is very simple: explore all the consequences of policies and actions, including not only short-term and long-term consequences, but also what actions cannot be done as a consequence of a initial policy or action (e.g. If you spend money on A, you cannot spend the same money on B -- or another way of saying you cannot eat your cake and have it too). Basically, the lesson is to be thorough in analysis of actions and policies. Mr. Hazlitt applies this lesson to a series of economic issues.It should be noted that many of the ideas in the book come from an 1850 essay by Frederick Bastiat, ""What is Seen and What is Unseen"".Using his lesson of thorough analysis, Mr. Hazlitt illustrates of how rent-control can lead to housing shortages, minimum-wage laws can lead to fewer jobs, and tariffs can lead to higher consumer prices. What is SEEN is the benefit to a special group (those in rent-controlled apartments, those with the jobs, or those receiving the protection of the tariff), but what is UNSEEN is the harm done to other groups (those that don'splitSize get the benefit of new housing, those who don'splitSize get jobs, and those who have to pay higher prices).My criticism of the book is that there is an ENORMOUS OMISSION. After examining so many topics, Mr. Hazlitt fails to even bring up the government intervention that has had the greatest impact on our economic and political lives (for good and evil), the CORPORATION. Corporations are the biggest influences in our political campaigns, the recipients of the many of the benefits of tariffs and subsidies, and are the focus of many of the regulations of our government.Mr. Hazlitt's book at least gives us the tools to look at the issue of the corporation.Corporations have three qualities that are different from other business types: limited liability, personhood, and the perpetual life. I will get you started with the analysis of limited liability.Limited liability means that an owner or stockholder cannot lose than he or she has paid for the shares of ownership regardless of the firm's debts.Limited liability cannot be created by a free-market. What is SEEN is that limited liability shields investors from risk, but what is UNSEEN is that the risk is transferred to the other parties, or stakeholders. To some of the stakeholders the acceptance of the risk is an implied contract; employees, creditors, suppliers and customers should aware that by doing business with a corporation they are taking on the risk of the results of actions done in the names of the owners (most corporation special-interest advocates label this government intervention as ""efficiency""). However, there is no implied contract with third parties (tort victims). If a corporation goes out of business owing money to third parties no one is held responsible, not owners, not managers. Limited Liability is government granted limited responsibility, or legalized irresponsibility. Government has transferred risks, and the associated costs without the associated benefits, to third parties.I urge all readers to use Mr. Hazlitt's method to answer, at least, the questions below.What are the short-term and long-term impacts of Limited Liability on each stakeholder -- investors, managers, employees, suppliers, creditors, and THIRD PARTIES (tort victims), competitors, citizens etc...? What is the impact on competition? How does limited liability change financial markets? How does limited liability relate to the size of organizations? What are the implications of limited liability to the different types of market failures such as Moral Hazard, Rent Seeking, and Market Control? What are the implications for the Principle-Agent problem? What do the large resources gained by means of limited liability mean in a court case where a corporation in matched against a tort victim or any individual? How does all this relate to problems like Superfund sites and asbestos claims? In general, who are the special interest groups that benefit and how do they emphasize the benefits of limited liability without mentioning the costs? In general, who are the groups that are hurt?Now, what are the implications of corporate personhood?There are a few other shortcomings in the book, but still it is a great exercise in thinking through ideas.Cheers."

You can'splitSize side-step the aformentioned phase in socio-economic development any more than you can side-step learning to add before attempting to multiply! Before the proletariat has any reason to overtake the plutocratic ""haves"", they must be beaten down and humiliated for generations.I am personally neither a socialist or libertarian. I am an observer who tends to shy away from systematic doctrine simply because it is useless in explaining such ineffable phenomena as human choice and behaviour. I respect those economists who embrace the chaotic nature of such phenomena and attempt to use them to their advantage.I just ordered this book from Amazon, and I can'splitSize wait to read it! Perhaps the game isn'splitSize over just yet.EDIT: Having read the book many times over now, I have to say I am truly impressed. It is much more unbiased than you might assume.

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A18I8EYPJK3XMA,James H. McDuffie,10/39,3.0,1054944000,Unconvinced and unimpressed,"Hazlitt analyzes the broken window fallacy as applied to everyday economics and economic policy. The basic idea of analyzing the consequences of economic policymaking on every group in society instead of just certain special interest groups is sound. But there is much more to this book than that. The Keynesians are decried and the book is essentially a tribute to laissez faire capitalism. This is fine except like Von Mises and the rest of the crowd there are implicit assumptions which are never addressed on every page. That is the basic problem with the deductive approach to economics: it is not deductive. Nobody ever points out that Hazlitt assumes virtually every curve in economics is linear or at best only very slightly nonlinear. That simple assumption despite what Hazlitt says is critical. The shape of these curves probably change over time and are deeply related to whether the ""free market"" or Keynesians are mostly correct. I suspect very strongly that which is best changes over time and that extremes either way are detrimental to the population and government. It has always been fascinating to me that although a large free market school has developed over time none of them appear to do any real mathematical or economic analysis ( If they did they would understand what a bunch of hooeey much of the content of this book and others is.) and that one notable free market proponent i.e. Greenspan may be getting ready to do a very Keynesian thing to the economy. In the long run objectivism and laissez faire capitalism have become interwined and confused over time and suffer from the same problems. I am not a government controls proponent. I have the same problem with the government intervention policies: it is essentially knob-twiddling and I have a congenital disorder which causes my rear end to seize up whenever the knob-twiddlers start up. It would be different if they actually knew what they were doing but even the stupid realize that they really don'splitSize and even Greenspan freely admits as much. Nor am I Keynesian in outlook. I noticed recently they are trying to justify themselves in textbooks by pointing out that inflation may not really cause much damage to the public and that what actually causes the damage are some of the things that occurred concurrently with inflation in the past. There oughta be a law against this kind of tripe. Inflating the economy just for the fun of it has caused all kinds of damage this century. There may be times when inflating the economy a little may be the way to proceed. But the hyperinflation of the 1965 - 1985 timeframe did many people in the population a great deal of harm and yes much of it was due to phenomenon which accompanied inflation instead of the inflation itself. But that may be the character of inflation. Many of the neo-Keynesians were in diapers during this time and the record is not as objective as a scientist would like. The truth lies somewhere out there at any given time and I suspect that economists that are not too tightly glued to any one school of thought are the most likely to find it. Let's hope someone is looking."

His arguments simply cannot be misunderstood. With nearly unassailable logic he explains the subtle economic implications of many government policies in terms the simplest novice can follow. This is an awesome book for any reader.This book was not at all what I expected when I ordered it. I expected a textbook like approach to all the classic concepts of economics (supply/demand curves, law of diminishing returns, effects of shortages/gluts on prices, etc.) Instead, Hazlitt simply states that true economics involves tracing both the seen and unseen consequences of each action or policy. This is primarily a book about government policy in economics, but it scope reaches to every choice we make with regard to the economic well-being of our nation.I had many 'Ah ha!' moments while reading this book. I felt I had a fairly good grasp on many economic prinicples after reading Skousen's 'The Making of Modern Economics', but Hazlitt has a way of crystalizing thoughts that are still fuzzy. One thing that comes through consistently is how money confuses and distracts people from a true understanding of wealth. Money is not wealth. True physical wealth lies in the products (goods and services) you have or can afford to buy. The wealth of a nation lies in the aggregate products it produces. If you want economic prosperity, increase production. Not senseless production, but production of things people actually want. When all is said and done, money is just the &quot;medium of exchange&quot;. Ultimately, all products are paid for by other products.Despite my high regard for this book, at times it dragged. Many topics are similar, and it seemed at times repetitive to go over the same ground again.I wish every American (especially politicians and aspiring politicians) would read this book."

Smyth ""EyeLean5280""",11/16,4.0,1262822400,"Very Good, But Be Aware of What You're Getting","This is an edited version of a review that I'd previously removed. People didn'splitSize feel the first version was helpful, a fact which I suspect to be due to two possibilities, depending upon the individuals involved. For one thing, it was very long. For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in ""It's a Wonderful Life""). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term ""trickle down theory.""But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some important aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,AWP70V34YS2IA,"Curt D ""Economic Philosophy and Political Eco...",8/12,5.0,1129507200,The only lesson the average person will ever need,"This is the easiest book that the average person can use to grasp economics, and in particular, the economics of all groups of people over an extended time period - ie: government policies.The book is a single, simple, practical example, followed by a series of examples of how governments break with the lesson and the outcome of doing so. It is a simple lesson, followed by simple examples, for people who have no experience with economics, or those who find the mathematical approach in college either overwhelming or irrelevant.For the average person, there may not need to be much else one needs to consider when weighing matters of import as a voter.Some of the reviews that are negative seem to express a dissatisfaction with the structure of the argument as being polemic. But, this is either nonsensical or a misunderstanding. When one wishes to illustrate the impact of a single idea, and the consequences of abusing it, and to do so on a vast scale, against those things which we assume daily to be successful, then one can choose to be Adam Smith, and drag the reader through tortuous detail with which he is unfamiliar, or one can paint broad debates, with which one is quite familiar, and which can be applied to one's daily experiences.This is simply the strategy one uses to communicate such ideas to a population that requests such an approach. It is not that such ideas cannot be conveyed through more detailed means, or that such a thing has not been done by other authors elsewhere, such as Hayek, Mises and Schumpater.For those on the left, who are in a long term campaign to destroy individual property rights, and those who deny that there is a necessary ignorance in individuals, groups or institutions, in a complex division of knoweldge, production and labor, this entire line of thinking appears either faulty or disingenuous. But it is not only honest, but true.For those that think government policy over the past 100 years has been successful, it has been successful in the same way that an inheritance given to a college student, allows the student to spend down the work of his predecessors. Money is not the only capital that must be earned and produced, so is knowledge and especially that knowledge which one cannot gain of one's own accord, but only through the experience of those who came before him. In particular, his family and culture.It took thousands of years to develop the capital-store of knowledge in European civilization, of which we are a part, and this knowledge resides in very simple ideas that we are surrounded by every day. This knowledge is a set of principles by which we can exist and prosper in an ever-expanding division of knowledge and labor, producing more and more complex goods and services in a larger and larger population, most of whom do not know each other, and who may not even know the end consumer, or what use their goods are put to or why. In a world of this complexity, we are necessarily ignorant, we must face an uncertain and ever changing future.It is expressly NOT a community of similar people all of whom know each other and share equally in production and it's results - which is the philosophy of a village or tribe. It is a simple primitive economic strategy for use by those who know little, and have few options.This evolution is the process of making peasants into princes. It is the process of transforming primitive social capitalism, which involves economic units of villages and families -- who do the same thing repeatedly and are certain of it, into modern western capitalism which involves economic units of families and individuals -- who do different things all the time, and are uncertain of everything. It makes all men into entrepreneurs. And in doing so, makes all men service all others, even if he does not know them.No man who has risen from poverty by building a business through discipline and hard work in the productive economy (versus the political, religious or academic economy - which are consumptive) and who would have his childen do the same, does so without learning this lesson.When a government prints money or redistributes money, it interferes with the process by which the generations in the population learn those habits traditions, ethics and behaviors that allowed them to raise from one economic strata in the division of knowledge and labor, into another. A loan to start a business is one thing, for it is the same as financing an education. A gift to make your life easier is something else altogether. It is giving a man a fish, not teaching him how to.This process works from the opposite direction as well. Even charity, which was the material obligation of those who were wealthy before government interference in the economy, and the traditional obligations and social pressure for the wealthy has been eroded.In the act of redistribution, the goverment indirectly manufactures economic ignorance in it's populace. Hazlitt does not say this directly, but he still says it.Our economy fell apart in the 1960's and 1970's, with what in the future will be called a great depression of the 1970's. It has been wealthy enough to tolerate this behavior since the 1980's, largely because of technological innovation and the prosperity that came from the competitive need to adopt it. But our position in the world is changing. European redistribution of wealth and social programs is failing now, and will of demographic necessity fail in the next two decades. It will fail here as well. Why such ponzi scheme's are comprehensible to the investment community, and not to the body politic will be a question to answer for sociologists for years to come.The peasants need to develop trust in one another, need to earn that trust in one another. They need to become comfortable with an uncertain future where they cannot understand all that happens in the vast universe of human cooperation, and to think longer term than their traditions tell them. And they must save. Because the future is uncertain in either case, and the repetitive certainty of the peasant philosophy was always an illusion. The had little to learn and learned little. There was little change and they changed little. They knew those close to them and knew others little. People starved. They died in ignorance and poverty. In a division of knowledge and labor, everything is so cheap, and increasingly so, that they instead, prosper and populations increase accordingly. And the price we all pay for this luxury is constant change, constant learning, and psychological uncertainty.There are means by which such inter-generational economic knoweldge can be imparted to a population, and by which the people can be compelled to adopt it despite the fact that they do not understand it. One can use religion and social ostricization as did the calvinist protestants and european jews, one can use ideological government by way of force and violence, as did the communists, socialists and facists. These methods remove choice from the individual and prescribe how we should act. But one can also achieve this end by using property rights alone, and a judiciary who does not prescribe anything at all, but only resolves differences in conflict over property, and nothing else is necessary. No politicians, prophets, intellectuals, sages. The population learns to serve on another without direction and prescription. This is the lesson.This is a conflict between princes and peasants. It is between property rights, individual responsibility for himself, savings, entrepreneurship and courage in the face of uncertainty, versus communal property, perpetual dependence, poverty and the comfort in the certainty of that future.We can all be princes of countries of one, or peasants in a country of billions. Hazlitt tells us the one lesson we need to know if we would all be princes."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A1VA170GUYGTB,Paula L. Craig,6/9,4.0,1090022400,Good But Some Holes,"Henry Hazlitt's book starts with a single lesson-that economics means looking beyond the immediate effects of any act or policy to the consequences of it for everyone. The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don'splitSize have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn'splitSize include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A31Y95BG0J2GIR,J. Martin,6/9,4.0,1074297600,Choose some alternatives and map them to the real world,"Of the positive reveiews, they seem to be amazed that someone can define economics. It's not really rocket science, and, in an age of plenty, it's not really about scarcity. It's about individuals making choices to maximize value. They may be bad choices, uniformed choices or perverse choices, but they have, in the final analysis, impact limited to the individual. And in most cases result in some level of increased individual satisfaction.The real danger, according to Hazlitt, is when the choices of a few people, with same kinds of fallacies noted above, are coercive, enforced by government or monopolies. Which leads us to to the negative reviews.The negatives, if we can be allowed to throw out the obvious loser rants, seem to be concerned mainly with rapacious corporations, free trade among inequal countries and natural monopolies. While these are certainly provide distortions of individual choice and informed consent, they do in the long run tend to be self correcting -- see government-sanctioned coal and oil monopolies. The real interest is in how to minimize the effects of these diseconomies.Hazlitt would argue that they are self-correcting via the collective effect of individual choices. The Marxists would argue that action based upon the sceeding of individual choice to a collective power is the solution. Surely, if we can assume there is no absolute, theoretical winner in this debate, we can look to the real world, based upon the actions of multiple forms of government and millions of individuals to provide some guidance on which path leads to the most for the most.To that end, I would challenge you to read Hazlitt's book and a Marxist equivalent like Ivan Ilich's &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and then, accepting both as plausibly complete and material, match them against your experience of recent history and your hopes for your personal future."

However his criticism of the unnamed ""brilliant economists""(p. 28)- read: Keynes-is certainly baseless and an attempt to debase another economist's (though I struggle to put Hazlitt in such a class) work for the reason that their works are difficult to read is quite contemptible. Are the works of Shakespeare less valuable, less brilliant because they are not easily interpreted by the average man? I think not, and it is from whence which we are lead to the largest, if not only, redeeming quality of EIOL: it is easy to read. A simple book by and for the simple man. True economics is fare more complicated that Hazlitt would have the reader believe, and despite what others might say, is fairly math intensive. However, I digress...EIOL, as such, a fallacious title, begins with what is a brief comment on economic theory and policy. However, as he sums up his point by saying that ""The art of economics consists of looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists of tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group, but for all groups.""(p. 17) All right folks, that's it. There is your one lesson. Go forth and spread the word. Those who are not versed in the study of economics I'm sure may arrive at the conclusion that this is something new, somehow ground breaking. However to anybody who is well-read in economics, to those who are a student of this subject, this seems to be, and is, nothing more than a pointing out of the obvious. Thanks for letting us know though, Henry. I thought all that stuff about the long run, short run, micro and macro economics was all fiction. Glad he told us.One could write an entire book refuting that which Hazlitt postulates, pointing out the errors, miscues, and theory which Hazlitt left out. I'm sure it was a mistake. Really. I am. I will note a few lines here, adding to that which has already been said by like-minded reviewers.Hazlitt ultimately ignores aggregate demand in chapters 2 & 3. Did he not say that we were supposed to be examining this with the perspective of ""all groups"" in mind? Furthermore, he attempts to use chapter 2, an examination into microeconomics, and apply it to aggregates and macroeconomic situations. Economists have long learned that this is not feasible. In the broken window example Hazlitt has us assume, only for thereason, we can suspect, to illustrate his point, that the Baker in question will spend the $250 on a suit. However, what fails to mention is that the possibility of savings exists. Had the Baker been planning to save the money, Hazlitt would struggle to make his point.In chapter 3, Hazlitt again ignores aggregate demand, but also the consumption function, and goes on to assume full employment, which is again, a special case which cannot be applied to the whole. In a number of instances he contradicts himself, though this is not limited to chapter 3. It would be a waste of time here to list all of them, however, consider the following: if the destruction of a building is a harm to all of those in a community (p. 28), and no demand is created, and more importantly, lost, where then is the harm? If my $250 which I would have spent a spent on a suit now goes to repairing my house, how then does the demand of the community suffer? Again on 28, when examining the farmer, can his demand not be greater, or less, than the available quantity of wheat he is able to supply? Could the demand on wheat not be less or greater than that which the farmer is able to supply? But we are supposed to believe that supply is equal to demand? I think not. On the subject of contradictions, returning to Lesson 1 for a second, Hazlitt criticizes the ""terms of abuse"" (p. 19), but uses the term ""new economics"", as his favorite whipping boy, falling into the same trap with which he assumes he has ensnared Keynesian economists. He blindly rejects all of Keynesian, or ""new economic"" theory, not crediting its merits or following reasoning. For shame, Henry. For shame.Students of economics do not read this book because it holds little value...except perhaps in showing how to present a poor argument. Hazlitt is guilty of employing reactionary ""reasoning"" to that of Keynesian theory, as noted by the multiple insults and jabs at Keynes and his followers, though he oft fails call them as such. This book makes some interesting, bordering on valid, points at times, however the degree to which it fails far outweighs the benefits. Readers of this book who are not economics students should not that this is certainly note the end-all and be-all of economic works or theory, and that every work on economics will be flawed to some degree. Economics students who reject Keynesian theory, read ""The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynsian Fallacies"" by Hazlitt.

In the second half of the 20th century, every government in the world that adopted Keynesian economics became enormously prosperous. Every time a government tried the so called ""free market"" economics Hazlitt recommends the result was high unemployment and a concentration of wealth. The sad fact is that some people are much, much better at making money than others, and that absent some government control, the rich wind up with everything and the workers with the bare minimum necessary to sustain life: the Iron Law of Wages. There is no doubt that free-market capitalism is the best economic system in every arena where there is a profit to be made. But the free market capitalists have to harden their hearts against the children, the elderly, the sick, and the victims of natural and man-made disasters, off whom no profit can be made. If money is your most important value, Hazlitt is right. But if you care about people, then Hazlitt is wrong."

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A12M1WWAGSH35S,John Anon,17/77,1.0,1327881600,Don'splitSize pan for gold in an open sewer,"Henry Hazlitt's book, Economics in One Lesson is really just a text book of how to be a reactionary. There are only a few of the chapters with any redeemable characteristics, but by no means is this book anything close to resembling something fit for human consumption, unless perhaps you are doing an anthropological study on 20th and 21st century mass-delusion.Chapter V: Taxes Discourage ProductionThe vast majority of this book is as fallacious and absurd as the propaganda promoted in this chapter. If I were to write a review of this book in its entirety, while illustrating each and every fallacy, the review would be longer than the book itself; so necessarily, I'll focus on a single argument in Chapter 5, perhaps the shortest chapter in the book.In this chapter he promulgates the quintessential argument of the modern day Republicans/Libertarians: that lowering taxes promotes jobs. Hazlitt mentions specifically personal and corporate income taxes. I could disprove this argument historically, but that will require more content than disproving it analytically, as follows.Hazlitt alludes to a number in saying: ""A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions"" without ever specifying a number or a guideline that could determine what that number should be. A few sentences later he says ""But the larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment."" There are numerous problems with this sentence but we'll focus on just one: presently many mega-corporations pay 0% or near 0% corporate taxes. Hazlitt argues in the previous sentence that there are ""essential government functions"" yet an increase from a 0% tax rate would be a ""deterrent to private production"". These two ideals are at such odds with each other that any level of taxation, or lack thereof, can be justified in any degree. To be timely with Hazlitt's own lifetime, let us consider a 48% (war-time) corporate tax rate from the previous example; now how do we decide which of these arguments apply? What is an essential government function? How do you validate that a company was going to use that money for production and not for enriching the CEO and upper management? This is vague on purpose, and this and other similar arguments have been used to reduce corporate taxes down to nothing on the mega-corporations, while we are left holding the bag.He then steps into briefly discussing personal income taxes. I'm not the hugest fan of income taxes in the way they presently exist, I think that they are a method by which unscrupulous politicians basically buy patronage from the voters with their own money, and an elimination of them (at the lower end) would perhaps cause a more nuanced and vigorous discussion of what creates prosperity among the general populace; as opposed to the voters allowing any trespass as long as the elected promise to lower taxes. Yet I can see the lack of justification that Hazlitt has for removing them, and the benefit to society when they are applied in a progressive fashion. That is presently not at all what we have at all in our system, and if they were re-implemented as originally intended with the middle class paying very little and it starting to go up at the upper-middle class levels then it would radically change the dialogue, and quality of life, in the country.First Hazlitt argues that high income taxes discourage work, but he's wrong in the following, critical, scenario.1) Imagine if there was one person in the company that effectively got to choose how much he was paid? If you were given this opportunity, how much would you pay yourself? The allocator of resources in a company (capital investment, money, labor) is primarily the CEO. The CEO has to go through the board in order to approve his wages, but in our modern world with our modern laws and systems of corporate governance this is little more than a formality in many major Fortune 500 companies. But if the CEO wanted to try to convince the board to give him a substantial raise that would make him pay 90% of it in income taxes, the board would have little incentive to let him, and more importantly he would have little incentive in pursuing it himself. This is a multi-causal problem to which having a very high progressive income tax can do much in stopping the abuse of. So what happens to that extra money that would have gone into the pockets of the CEO and upper management if prevented by tax policy? Well, if we look at history, that money was reinvested into the company and it lifted the general people's standard of living as a function of economic growth. If the pay is effectively `capped' in this manner, perhaps the CEO and other `higher ups' will (and should) receive a higher compensation for the importance of their work, in the form of company stocks. This will also encourage them to aim for the long term growth of the company, rather than looting it intentionally or as a by-product of ""short-termism"" and then diving out with a golden parachute, as is so commonplace today. Economic growth is much higher if there is the maximum amount of reinvestment; this is what the very high progressive income tax promotes. In this system, value creation is rewarded (long term growth) and short-termism and `looting' is discouraged.Hazlitt also argues that reinvestment is discouraged by ""high levels of taxation"".2) Assume the CEO got the money in the above scenario (not hard to do, since we live in a world now that has very low income tax rates on this form of abuse). Now what does he do with it? Does he start a new startup company? Not likely at all, after working for a company enough to get a CEO position why start over as a 'small timer' again? Why do anything but perform your tenure at the company you're CEO at and then retire? Entrepreneurs start businesses; people that make a bunch of money in the stock market don'splitSize, people that are existing CEO's don'splitSize, people that come from dynastic families of great wealth don'splitSize, at least they don'splitSize in any greater observable proportion than the general populace. I would suggest that they are much less likely to become an entrepreneur of a new company - for those of you unaware: the primary point of becoming rich is that you no longer have to work - a novel concept. If you want evidence of this please look at Fortune 500 and who founded them and what their background was, if this 'theory' that the rich create jobs and by extension taxing the rich destroys jobs was correct you'd at least expect to see a larger proportional amount of the ""a priori rich"" in these roles. In summation: A.) People with ideas and the moxy to see them to fruition start businesses, not those with incredible sums of money. B.) Newly founded businesses typically borrow from banks and are self financed by-in-large over the private investor to which lower income taxes benefit.I know personally a handful of people that make 6 figure salaries a year and they work incredibly hard for that money, and I consider that they truly earned it, and that they are paying too much in taxes at present. And yet their income has a ""reality-check"" as what they are paid reflects a `market price' for their services. No such ""market-check"" or ""sanity-check"" exists for the upper management of many of these mega-corps; this is the problem that is smoke-screened behind arguments furthered by Hazlitt's book and his modern contemporaries.So in this scenario, high income taxes that are progressively applied encourage production. This flies in the face of all Libertarian and ""right wing"" (whatever that fake dichotomy means anymore) ideology, yet it is what is observed. There is no ideological ""general rule"", as promoted by Hazlitt, that you can use to presuppose the outcome of a specific tax without looking at the specifics. But Hazlitt doesn'splitSize want you look at specifics, he is training you to be a reactionary. There are some useful things in this book - as there are in nearly all books. Yet, if a book, such as this one, is about 95% garbage and 5% useful analysis; I'd tell you that there are better places to pan for gold than in an open sewer.Be mindful that, in this book, in a chapter this small, there are many more fallacies that Hazlitt packs in that I must leave aside for the sake of brevity.One of the primary reasons justifying these methods of taxation that has hitherto been unmentioned, is if they are progressively implemented, they can prevent the scenario that we are living right now - a political establishment that has been bought with this ill-gotten money. By a willful chiseling away of our laws on taxation, it has empowered a new class of dynastic robber-barons in our modern era."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A3BQYQJMIQ20V8,Amazon_reviews,14/69,1.0,1322524800,Flawed,"The basic idea of this book basically focuses on the idea of Pareto Efficiency (which is the economic idea that a policy should benefit all or it should not be undertaken). He takes Pareto Efficiency to extremes and uses it to basically launch into an attack on any wealth redistribution. The major criticism is that no economic policy could ever benefit every single person.Many of his ideas are flawed:High taxes discourage production: in fact from 1949-79, when highest tax rate was 70-90%, GDP grew at 2.4%, then when taxes were cut (1979-90) GDP growth was 2%. So in fact high taxes don'splitSize necessarily mean low production.Price fixing is not good, even as far as minimum wage should be abolished. But these price fixing (including rent control) are there for the poor. Price controls are placed when the free market allocates the poor less than a fair share of a good. This applies for minimum wage. Minimum wage is there to protect the poor, not the middle class or rich, who are often not working at minimum wage. Minimum wage may decrease the profits of a company and increase cost to the consumer, but this allows some redistribution from the more well off to the less well off. If we abolish minimum wage, it is the poor who suffer. Cut the minimum wage, people would have to work harder to earn the same amount. Minimum wage might not be efficient for the rich and well off, but a society is better off when more are protected.Overall, this flawed analysis highlights how some economic policy is there to benefit the rich.Read this book instead:Economics for the Rest of Us: Debunking the Science That Makes Life Dismal"

For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in ""It's a Wonderful Life""). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term ""trickle down theory.""But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have some merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too."

I set out to kill two birds with one stone, however found myself rather surprised. While it applied to economics and taught and reiterated my class at school, it really drove home the ideas of philosophy. This book related to my philosphy and critical thinking class, because Henry Hazlitt makes a claim in the first chapter of the book and the following twenty five are the lesson being applied in economic terms. He makes sure you understand and can apply his claim/lesson to the real world, all while showing you the faults many economist make. All of his supporting stories are relevant and make since, they are all clearly written making sure his own view is shown, and they are complete, taking into consideration all points of view.The book points out the fallacies of claims made by economists, and in doing so teaches you economics, and how to think correctly as one. He does not, however, take a typical approach to this economics thing. He throws you right in and teaches you the lesson right away. His lesson asks you to remember one thing.""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act of policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.""This claim was something I was taught in my economics class, and I gladly related to it while reading. Some of my favorite chapters had to do with the broken window fallacy, minimum wage laws, and the mirage on inflation. All breaking down the faults of our government and the faults in our reasoning. Every chapter in the book brings home the main message of looking past the up front realities. To look outside of the box.I felt Hazlitt took on a fair view of the people. He stated many times,""if we have trained ourselves to look beyond immediate to secondary consequences."" I think this applies to many people. The word if leaves it open, covering all individuals. He also puts in his lesson, ""not merely for one group but for all groups."" He does look at it for all groups, mentioning all people who would feel the effects of whatever program is put into place.I honestly liked reading the book. If you are an economics or philosophy major, both of which I am not, the book is worth more closer review. I would recommend it to anyone looking to find faults or learn economics."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2B17NWHVHDOM3,Hutchinson Persons,10/20,3.0,953424000,Very Good If One Can Get Past The Sarcasm,"Henry Hazlitt happens to be right. Perhaps with so few of this kind -- economic works which are logical and correct -- I should have given it 5 Stars. I expect a lot.Henry is right: Too often so-called ""economists"" take only short term, one-sided, special interest group viewpoints and come up with half-baked economic plans and plots. Enough people accept these, allowing such ideas to become everyday government practice; practices that frankly screw us all in the long run. From the idiocy of Keynes to the ideas behind the communistic thievery of FDR's ""New Deal"", Hazlitt cuts through and clarifies many false economic concepts. Hazlitt explains and demonstrates again and again how real economics is the science of the effects of any financial practice on everything and everyone. He also points out conceptually how similarly a country's government's economic decisions and preferences mimic the values and choices of one's own pocketbook. And Henry offers a very nice reprise of Bastiat's the seen versus the unseen.Unfortunately, Hazlitt suffers from one of the same problems Ayn Rand did. Since this book was first published during Rand's writing of Atlas Shrugged, I suspect Economics in One Lesson may have had a large effect on both style and content of Atlas. Both authors had to fight so long and so hard for their ideas, with so little appreciation they often resorted to sarcasm just to make a little mental space for themselves. This puts a strain on the reader, as one attempts to understand, integrate and connect up the longer chain of events and results of various economic practices undertaken by governments and the people they represent.Also, though his points are excellent, he often leaves certain links in the chain vague, expecting the reader to just get it--when crossing those bridges on one's own requires some serious backtracking and analysis.Regardless, his ideas are so important, and once one gets to them, so well made, I wish Henry could have written a simpler, more direct, less sarcastic, less complaining, less wordy, better-linked version of this very good work.Nevertheless, if I were able to speak with Henry, I would say: ""Thank you."""

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A1JA55BW3T7WZJ,S. J Mahoney,2/4,4.0,1293321600,Law of unintended consequences,"Hazlitt is one of the prominent voices in the Austrian flavor of Economics. This version of Economics has recently come to the mainstream in light of the economic hardships and out of control spending from the federal government. This book is dated but contains a lot of relevant information. I was surprised to see just how big of a concern inflation and deficit spending was in the 40s to these very intelligent and honest economists.What will you find inside? Well the bottom line is everything you do, no matter how noble, affects someone else in the world of economics. If the government steps in to help one group of people it is hurting another group of people, usually resulting in a net harm. This is because anytime you artificially stimulate, subsidize or promote one behavior over another you are promoting inefficiency or protecting the least profitable option. This raises prices on goods and decreases real wages. The only way to create wealth and grow the economy is to produce more of a product with the same or less effort. This will in the long run make everyones cost of living lower and bring more prosperity to the country. A great example he used was the hypothetical situation where the government continued to subsidize the horse and buggy industry despite the innovation of the automobile. Sure jobs were lost when cars started replacing horse drawn carriages but eventually more jobs were created and the country was a whole lot better off. He also dispels the myth of saving too much money and discusses why it's necessary to save and what your savings accomplishes.Other discussions include real world examples of why labor unions are harmful to the economy, why it's bad to raise minimum wage, evils of price fixing, the problem with subsidizing, rent stabilization and who it hurts, inequities and harm of tariffs, and much much more. I deduct a star from the book because it got a little repetitive after awhile. A lot of the arguments are repeated and there is a definite recurring theme in every problem he poses. This is not to detract from it's validity, and each problem does propose a unique flavor of this principle. A lot of these things I knew were intuitively wrong but the examples he gives makes you nod your head and puts your gut thought into words. This book was a refreshingly easy read and very insightful."

Hazlitt claims that today's economists forget the most frequent fallacy committed by professionals, the fallacy of short-term effects on specific groups rather than society as a whole. Hazlitt utilizes multiple examples of past economic policies that have failed, and what initially brought those policies to closure. After thoroughly reading Economics In One Lesson, my thoughts on the economy have transformed from little knowledge of the subject to a complete understanding of past economic failures.The premises on production, inflation, and wages carry true statements, but seem outdated. Statistics and numbers used for basic economic explanations are recorded prior to 1980. For economic interest the premises remain true, but need updating for today's economist.Hazlitt illustrates excellent reasoning to the fallacy of short-term effects on specified groups through many simple ideas. The first reason describes means of production and societies resistance to work for low wages. For companies to produce, workers are needed as producers. If company A's output increases, workers wages increase. If company A has an increase in production consequently company B suffers. Company B's output decreases, and the workers receive no wage increase. Society will only see the benefits of company A, not the monetary losses by Company B. Secondly, prices, profits, and costs to society. Hazlitt relates prices to the law of supply and demand. When consumers demand more of a product that is available from a certain business, people will buy more of the product. Both the price and profits will increase for the business. If the demand is met, the supply increases production meaning consumers increase their buying from that particular company. If consumers only buy from that particular company, other related businesses lose the profits for their product. Hazlitt's arguments remain deductively valid throughout the explanations of the prior fallacy.Economics commits multiple fallacies if not carefully followed through with each policy and system. Hazlitt outlines many fallacies with the main point representing the fallacy of short term effects on one particular group rather than the long term effects on all groups, or the fallacy of over looking secondary consequences. Hazlitt briefly describes other fallacies, such as, the broken window fallacy and overlooking the general consequences fallacy. Although Hazlitt depicts several fallacies, I failed to see where he committed fallacies of his own.Economics can be broken down into many parts and Hazlitt thoroughly describes each piece of those parts. Hazlitt's points are made exceptionally clear and to the point. Hazlitt's ideas are simple for the unclear mind but involve a considerable amount of thinking for today's economist. As stated before, economists often fail to realize secondary consequences to their actions.The economic fallacy claims are fairly consistent throughout the book. The central fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences constitutes a major portion of the book. Hazlitt uses several illustrations to back up his claims of the failure to see secondary consequences and the impact they had on economic policies. Almost every economic policy commits a fallacy, and Hazlitt easily describes the fallacies and failures to the readers.The arguments that Hazlitt conveys provide a complete understanding for economic fallacies and the impact they have on policies today. All evidence that Hazlitt uses on economic fallacies relates policy failures to overlooking secondary consequences. If today's economist only see the benefit of company A or product 1 rather than the suffering of company B or profit losses of product 2, economic policies will continue to fail. Hazlitt brings all aspects of the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences into account for the purposes of this book. Hazlitt's arguments seem fair and support all views of economic progressions and failures in the mid 1900's. The presentation of both sides creates equal representation for all readers. The opposing views carry strong arguments, but do not change the weight of the writer's outlook. Hazlitt's opinion illustrates the truth of economics, and the impact of policy failures on society.The key points of Hazlitt's book touch on several different economic stabilizers. Hazlitt begins with a strong introduction about the fallacy of overlooking general and secondary consequences. It is made clear that many professionals commit this fallacy over and over again. If economists and other professionals thoroughly verify the benefits and losses by the whole group rather than the benefits or impacts on one group, policies enacted will continue to work and increase profits, production, and costs in the economy today. Other fallacies are used to demonstrate the power of overlooking secondary consequences. The broken window fallacy, illustrates the benefits and losses within three parties. If a window is broken in Company A, but the owner wanted a product from Company B, the owner's situation becomes complicated. Now A has to buy a window from Company C instead of the needed product from B. Company A loses money to C, which should have supported B. Company C benefits, but Company B suffers. Hazlitt uses great ideas to support all of his arguments, and can be easily understood by all readers."

The main premise of the book is that: ""Economics, as we have now seen again and again, is a science of recognizing secondary consequences. It is also a science of seeing general consequences. It is the science of tracing the effects of some proposed or existing policy not only on some special interest in the short run, but on the general interest in the long run."".In addition to the unique approach taken by the author he is committed to making the material accessible to all: ""I have tried to write this book as simply and with as much freedom from technicalities as is consistent with reasonable accuracy, so that it can be fully understood by a reader with no previous acquaintance with economics."" A definite read for all!Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- ""A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions. Reasonable taxes for this purpose need not hurt production much. The king of government services then supplied in return, which among other things safeguard production itself, more than compensate for this. But the larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment. When the total tax burden grows beyond a bearable size, the problem of devising taxes that will not discourage and disrupt production becomes insoluble.""2- ""There is no limit to the amount of work to be done as long as any human need or wish that work could fill remains unsatisfied. In a modern exchange economy, the most work will be done when prices, costs, and wages are in the best relations with each other.""3- ""...our real objective is to maximize production. In doing this, full employment - that is, the absence of involuntary idleness - becomes a necessary by-product. But production is the end, employment merely the means. We cannot continuously have the fullest production without full employment. But we can very easily have full employment without full production.""4- ""Paradoxical as it may seem to some, it is just as necessary to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die as that growing industries be allowed to grow. The first process is essential to the second.""5- ""So government policy should be directed, not to imposing more burdensome requirements on employers, but to following policies that encourage profits, that encourage employers to expand, to invest in newer and better machines to increase the productivity of workers - in brief, to encourage capital accumulation, instead of discouraging it - and to increase both employment and wage rates.""6- ""Profits, in short, resulting from the relationships of costs to prices, not only tell us which goods it is most economical to make, but which are the most economical ways to make them. These questions must be answered by a socialist system no less than by a capitalist one; they must be answered by any conceivable economic system; and for the overwhelming bulk of the commodities and services that are produced, the answers supplied by profit and loss under competitive free enterprise are incomparably superior to those that could be obtained by any other method.""7-""Inflation is the autosuggestion, the hypnotism, the anesthetic, that has dulled the pain of the operation for him. Inflation is the opium of the people.""8- ""Saving, in short, in the modern world, is only another form of spending. The usual difference is that the money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to increase production."""

He address topics such as:Short term vs. long term view of economic principle and policiesDo public works truly stimulate the economy?How much taxation is too much?Does all automation destroy jobs in the long term?Does full employment always mean full production?Who's ""protected"" by tariffs?Saving the X Industry (Bailout anyone?)How does government price fixing work?Minimum wage laws and what they really doDo unions really raise wages?What is the function of profits? What truly causes Inflation? What does it truly mean to save and create wealth?Do any of these topics sound interesting or applicable to what you're hearing in today's political talk in the media? Get this. Hazlitt wrote this in 1946! The principles he lays out and the fallacies he exposes could have been written about current events today! This, to me, gives weight to his school of thought. If his economic worldview could be applied to virtually every day and age, it bolsters its credibility. Instead of fly-by-night knee jerk reactionary policies, Haziltt, a member of the Austrian school of economics, gives common sense explanations to what most of the political world would prefer to keep as complicated as possible.

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,AQEBTMSP1FQ8P,FinancePro,4/4,5.0,1329696000,The Lesson of Liberty Is Difficult for Many to Learn,"I purchased the 1979 edition of Hazlitt's book as a MBA candidate at Pepperdine University. My professor, the erudite and sharp minded Dr. George Reisman, wanted to instill in his students the fundamental principle of liberty and how government attempted to disrupt and eradicate that liberty at every opportunity. Intervention was its means and totalitarianism was its method.Hazlitt is no exception when it comes to upholding liberty. His book attests to the vitality of his work. The book's rankings on Amazon demonstrates how oppressed people seek for answers to fend off the oppressors and their interventionists policies through a corrupt government. He begins the work at the place Ken Starr did in a lecture I attended in which he reviewed his prosecutorial experience with former President Clinton: the broken window. There are striking parallels between the economic principle and the moral principle that Starr applied. Both involved the impact of vandelism in a corrupt society. The two vandels existed in separate segments of society, but the net effect was the same: the destruction of long term value that may not be visible to the naked eye. One was theft of private property through its destruction (the broken window) and the other the theft of societal morals through political corruption.One might ask, ""How in the world can you make this parallel?"" Easy. Hazlitt argues from the fallacy of destruction. When destruction occurs in any area of society, whether in economics or politics, part of society gets destroyed. He argues that economists who argue for the destructiveness of war see it as a good thing when the opposite is true. When destruction occurs, it wipes out capital, and when that happens, wealth declines. The same is true in Clinton's case, except the capital of a moral society declined (and it continues to do so thanks to an immoral president). Adam Smith makes it clear that economics and morality work hand in hand. Hazlitt confirms this.The other part of destruction is when the government intervenes through heavy taxation and regulation. It performs a similar theft of capital by converting capital into consumption (i.e., public works projects) and stifles the growth of capital, productivity, and the economy. Hazlitt wrote his first edition just after the destructive reign of Roosevelt who presided over the greatest destructive measures in US history with his heavy taxation, tarriffs, deficit spending, and regulations. We saw the longest capital destroying Depression in modern history followed by one of the most destructive wars this nations every experienced that sucked capital out of the economy to feed the war through deficit financing. Hazlitt covers both of these types of destruction to the economy successfully. While it appears that war creates capital, this is deceitful.All war does is shift capital from other industries toward the industries that support the war. A further aggrevation of the economy was rationing. With the shifting of capital toward consumption and destruction, rationing of scarce supplies occurred, and guess who was in charge of it? That's right! The government. The result of rationing industries from where capital got shifted to support war industries had their capital stolen, thereby leading to rationing of what was left over in those industries.As these war industries absorbed capital for producing war equipment that gets destroyed, there is insufficient capital reinvested. Conseqently, the entire economy suffered.Then Hazlitt gets into a topic that burns hot today - picking winners and losers among industries and companies. Hazlitt observed the same problem then as exists now with the Obama administration: proping up industries (banks, auto, etc.) at the expense of taxpayers (both individuals and companies). The results is corporate cronyism and corruption. This is how economics and morality get married. In essense, Obama is no different from Clinton in destroying the moral fiber of our nation through the reallocation of wealth and its destruction while he does it. Hazlitt saw that almost 80 years ago and warned us about it.Those who argue against Hazlitt and his economics are really short-sighted in not being able to see all sides of the economic picture. They miss the point of the very simple but powerful illustration Hazlitt provides at the beginning about the broken window. They see only the consumption side (the loss and new replacement that makes it appear that nothing happened) and not the capital side (the siphoning off of capital through destruction so that eventual capital is lost). Hazlitt points out this ignorance, which makes his message long lasting and popular.Free people do not like to be controlled whether by government, unions (which Hazlitt also addresses), or vandels. All three of these entities not only destroy or reduce capital but also the moral principles behind the creation of capital. They produce nothing because that is not their purpose. Their purpose is destruction and control, the opposite of liberty, moral sentiments (Adam Smith), and productivity that leads to a vibrant economy."

That his book is a heavy dose of free market economics thus should be no surprise. Neither should be his approach: that of judging economic policies in view of their total effects, not just on a favored interest group, but on all groups, and not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well. For over sixty years this is the tune Hazlitt has been singing. And surprisingly, it is a tune that still strikes a modern-day chord.Deficit spending, inflation, farm subsidies, trade tariffs--pick your modern day issue and you'll find a chapter or two directed to it here. Looking at each through what some might call an Austrian lens, Hazlitt focuses on their supposed fallacies in an upfront, un-intimidating manner. It makes for an enticing presentation--which is likely the reason for its stunning decades-long resilience--but admittedly, its age is beginning to show.The intricacies of modern finance are not to be untangled here, nor is the role of finance in modern economics even acknowledged. Similarly, though the importance of trade is trumpeted, the complexities of globalization are not to be forecast. For these issues, you'll have to turn to books like Greg Ip'sThe Little Book of Economics: How the Economy Works in the Real World (Little Books. Big Profits)or Alan Greenspan's surprisingly readableThe Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World(Tom Friedman'sThe World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Centuryalso isn'splitSize bad, but it is a bit too folksy). Approaching economics from an initial condition of equilibrium also seems a bit flat, if only because it describes an economy that doesn'splitSize exist.Hazlitt's prescience regarding the results of unnaturally low interest rates, deficit spending, and government subsidies of the housing market, however, are astonishingly accurate in view of the recent economic malaise. That government subsidized mortgages with little to no downpayment from buyers could lead to a glut of bad loans, an oversupply of housing, and a cancerous malinvestment of capital are lessons we are ruing today and risks he warned of decades ago. That we didn'splitSize recognize them sooner supports Mr. Hazlitt's ultimate conclusion that our problems are less economic than political, and, with the rest, makes his short little book on economics exceptionally enticing, if not surprisingly resilient."

First: in the Introduction there are a few thinly veiled and unsupported pot shots taken at major economists with whom Hazlitt disagrees (Keynes). Second: The title of the book is misleading. This book is a polemic and not a survey of the field of economics.I should also address the very silly criticisms made against this book by some of the other revewiers. Most of these critical reviewers entirely misunderstand the point of the book. The book is intended as a lucid refutation of certain extremely common anti-capitalist economic fallacies. That is all. Thus, criticisms like ""this book fails to address: game theory, natural monopolies, the pricple-agent problem, labor market friction, some advanced math technique, etc"" are simply irrelevant.

It was my introduction to critical thinking and it gripped me from page one. The pellucid logic of Hazlitt's demonstration of Frederic Bastiat's ""broken window"" fallacy as the key to understanding the core principles of economics challenged everything I thought I knew (as son of a socialist). I initially resisted his free market conclusions but eventually decided he was right. The ideas he encapsulated so eloquently kept burning in the back of my mind, and I began to understood that freedom was more than just a catalyst of prosperity. I found myself motivated to get a high school diploma and eventually a college degree. (Thanks for the push, Henry!)One might expect the power of such ideas to have a more lasting impact, and for a while it did. The Soviet Union flopped and tyrannies around the world began to fall. Free market ideas made a dramatic comeback in America and it seemed we'd outgrown the need for books like Economics in One Lesson.But here we are in 21st Century riding the political pendulum back toward the Orwellian left: a metastasizing, unelected federal bureaucracy pushing a ""leveling"" regulatory steamroller over our flattened liberties and discarded Constitution; an administration intent on piecemeal nationalization the health care system; a Congress boiling with new laws, new plans for a smothering Beltway governance.That's why like this are timelessly relevant.

The &quot;Austrians&quot; vindicate the market economy's spontaneous order as the surest way to have optimal prosperity, opportunity, and individual liberty for the masses. The verbal logic and reasoning of the Austrian school is generally easy to understand and makes sense to the reader. Needless, to say my interest in the laissez-faire perspective grew - and I read and amassed a library of hundreds of interrelated books on various disciplines from economics to history to political theory.

First of all this book was orginally written in the 40's after the war, and then again in the early 70's. But it is as timeless today as it was when it was written. One of the greatest features about this book as the authors approach, is that he gives the most basic example, and then builds on it throughout the book, giving it a readable quality to an incredibly wage range and age of readers. They can merely read to their example level of understanding, and if they don'splitSize go anyfarther than they will still understand more about basic economics that the majority of adults. For adults, I find that he put it in just clear examples of everything we have heard our whole lifes and explained the true ramifications of the policies....without a doubt each a failure.

I fall into the later one.I picked this book up a few years ago to gain a basic understanding of Austrian economics. In this aspect the book is perfect. This is the first economics book I read outside of a college text book. It delivers some stories and helps you understand how one economic policy affects the lives of everyday people. I found the book to be easily readable. It is not as complicated as I thought a economics book had to be, nothing like a college economic's text book.The book generally helps you understand how a economic policy is meant to help one group of people will affect another. The book urges the reader to think more clearly about these policies by looking at the unseen problems it will create for other groups of people. The first chapter outline's this perfectly.I did go into reading this book with a already set Libertarian political view on most issues and wanted to better understand Austrian economics. You will understand it more after reading this book."
B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A2I1XJPF9Y1LDY,John Butler,1/1,5.0,1332028800,Arguably the most common sense book on economics ever written,"Henry Hazlitt was not only a gifted economist. He wrote in a no-nonsense style, demolishing seemingly persuasive, highly complex or even tortured arguments in favour of suboptimal economic policies. Much as Copernicus placed the sun, rather than the earth, at the centre of the solar system, thereby greatly simplifying astronomical calculation and eventually enabling Kepler and Newton to explain planetary motion and gravity in simple, eloquent equations, so Hazlitt masterfully simplifies the world of economics, in both theory and practice. Each chapter of Economics in One Lesson is a tour-de-force critique of one or more misguided economic policies. In his own time, using his powerful economic insight, he was able to predict a broad range of future economic developments, including the dollar devaluation and stagflation of the 1970s, the devastating impact of rent control on urban housing, the counterproductive effects of trade barriers and the distorting aspects of many forms of regulation, taxation and government subsidies. Armed with the common sense knowledge explained cogently in this volume, non-economist readers will find they can make much better sense of economic developments and see far easier through politicians' and policy makers' frequently deceptive arguments and false promises. Economics in One Lesson is more than just an outstanding book, it is probably the best introductory book on economics ever written.John Butler, author of The Golden Revolution: How to Prepare for the Coming Global Gold Standard (John Wiley and Sons, 2012)"

Our elected representatives, backed by powerful entities, exploit this confusion for their own advantage. This book, written in 1962 by Henry Hazlitt, educates the reader with sound, time-tested economic truths. It refutes those arguments put forth by special interests whose objective is merely to advance their own financial advantage over their competition, not to advance the truth about economic activity. ""Economics in One Lesson"" is written to the common man, it is not technical and dry as are academic style texts that are written on this subject. Hazlitt distills a complex subject into basic principles which anyone who manages a household's expenses can understand. I recommend this book as a ""must read"" for everyone who votes. A vote cast for a politician who promises economic prosperity based on a FLAWED understanding of ""cause and effect"", is a wasted vote and produces disappointing results for us all."

Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation. In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples."

An idea or political initiative can have a great stated goal such as ""lets pass a law against cigarettes when illegal no one or at least far fewer people will smoke, we will all be healthier, health care cost will go down etc"" this sounds like a great idea but Hazlitt introduces to the equation the problem of unintended consequences. Sure the government can make cigarettes illegal but there are the unintended consequences to this, when ever there is a good people want there will be someone to provide it, much like with illegal drugs today the providers will be violent street gangs, and drug cartels. Street gangs could smuggle tobacco in from other countries or grow it here in America much like what they do now with drugs, the result will be giving them something else they can monopolize the sale of, gives them even more power and money, creates even more violence on the streets, more innocent youths get shot and killed in street gang tobacco selling turf wars etc.I do not recall seeing the particular example of cigarettes in the book but I just decided to brief on a relevant topic today to illustrate the idea of Hazlitt's book.Hazlitt goes through many examples of popular goody goody government initiatives that appear all well and do on the outside but have many honorific unintended consequences.This book will enable you to look at proposed legislation with a completely different set of eyes, seeing through the rhetoric of the stated goal and to the nitty gritty of the likely resultsThis book along with Irwin Schiff's ""the biggest con"" are two of my must haves for anyone pursing self education in free market economics.5 stars"

It's all about affirming selfishness and how the rights of big business are much more important than the rights of the individual. Additionally some of his arguments are VERY flawed. For example, he says that there can never really be a trade deficit because American dollars can only be exchanged for American exports. Well Henry, that's not quite true as we learned from the Japanese. American dollars also work quite nicely for buying American real estate and American businesses. It turns out you can do more with a dollar than buy exports.The author also argues that you can not make money by giving away your products, but you can. All you have to do is force your competition out of business by giving away your product until you establish a monopoly. Then you can charge whatever you like. For all his rhetoric about not being short-sighted, he sure mucks it up himself.Although the author has the occasional valid point, most of his arguments are extremely pro-corporation and anti-labor.

Comparative statics, production functions and all that fun stuff (Chiang, Varian, Judge, Theil, etc.,etc.). I thought this book might be really trivial, but it's not. This book has absolutely none of the quantitative stuff, but it is very heavy on reasoning through economic relationships and effects.This book takes a theme from Frederic Bastiat (that which is seen and that which is unseen) and develops and illustrates it. Basically, Hazlett goes through economic policy arguments and illustrates not only the seen (favorable) effects, but lays out all of the ""unseen"" negative effects. Based solely on an understanding of supply and demand, the fact that resources are scarce, and that people will act to maximize their own welfare, Hazlitt shows how horribly misguided and counterproductive many economic policies are. Although originally written back in 1946 (with lots of references to New Deal programs) it is just as relevant to todays economic policy proposals and arguments.I really can'splitSize recommend this book highly enough.
